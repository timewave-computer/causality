# SSZ FFI Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the SSZ FFI replacement plan, which focused on establishing the core infrastructure for SSZ serialization in the Causality system:

1. **Rust SSZ Implementation**
   - Created a new `causality-ssz` crate that adopts the `ethereum_ssz` library
   - Defined SSZ type wrappers for core TEL types (Resource, Effect, Handler, Edge)
   - Implemented serialization and deserialization for primitive types
   - Added feature flags for gradual adoption

2. **OCaml SSZ Integration**
   - Extended the existing `ml_causality/lib/ssz` module with TEL type support
   - Implemented serialization routines for OCaml TEL representations
   - Added SSZ type definitions for all TEL graph components
   - Created serialization helpers to simplify usage

3. **Type Schema Alignment**
   - Defined canonical SSZ schemas for all shared types
   - Documented binary layout standards for cross-language compatibility
   - Created validators to ensure OCaml and Rust implementations produce identical bytes
   - Implemented schema versioning mechanism for future-proofing

4. **FFI Layer Design**
   - Designed a clean new FFI interface for the Rust-OCaml boundary
   - Created SSZ-based serialization/deserialization functions for FFI
   - Implemented memory management for crossing language boundaries
   - Created comprehensive test vectors for TEL types
   - Added validation and error handling at the FFI boundary
   - Implemented round-trip testing framework for verification

5. **Disk Serialization**
   - Implemented file I/O operations for SSZ-serialized objects in Rust
   - Created corresponding file I/O operations in OCaml
   - Defined a common binary file format with magic bytes and versioning
   - Added support for both single object and multiple object serialization
   - Created comprehensive tests for the file format in both languages

## Implementation Details

### Rust Side
- The new `causality-ssz` crate provides SSZ serialization for TEL graph objects
- Implemented conversion traits (`IntoSsz`, `FromSsz`) for all types
- Created FFI functions for transferring objects between languages
- Added memory management functions to prevent leaks
- Implemented disk serialization with a versioned file format
- Added validation functions to verify SSZ data correctness
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error reporting

### OCaml Side
- Extended the SSZ module with TEL type support
- Created C stubs that call into the Rust FFI layer
- Implemented serialization routines for OCaml TEL types
- Added test files for validation
- Added corresponding disk serialization support matching the Rust implementation
- Implemented round-trip testing framework for serialization verification
- Added validation functions to check data integrity

### File Format
- Defined a standard file format with magic bytes ("TELG") to identify TEL graph files
- Included versioning to support future format evolution
- Added object type identification and count in the header
- Supported both single object and multiple object collections
- Implemented length-prefixed encoding for multiple objects

## Next Steps

To complete the migration to SSZ serialization, we need to:

1. **Complete FFI Layer**
   - Add fuzzing tests for serialization robustness
   - Create benchmarks to measure performance improvements

2. **Integrate with DSL and Runtime**
   - Update the OCaml DSL to emit SSZ-serializable objects
   - Modify the OCaml and Rust runtimes to use SSZ serialization
   - Create seamless type conversions

3. **Migration Strategy**
   - Implement dual-mode support during transition
   - Update all FFI call sites in both languages
   - Create adapter functions for backward compatibility

4. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Remove legacy serialization code
   - Finalize the build system changes

## Benefits

The SSZ serialization approach brings several benefits:

1. **Performance**: SSZ is more efficient than S-expressions for binary data
2. **Type Safety**: The schema-based approach ensures data integrity
3. **Merkleization**: SSZ enables easy Merkle tree generation for verification
4. **Compatibility**: Standardized format for cross-language communication
5. **Future-Proofing**: Schema versioning enables backward compatibility
6. **Persistence**: Common file format for both OCaml and Rust
7. **Validation**: Enhanced error handling and validation at the FFI boundary

## Estimated Timeline

Phase 2-6 of the project are expected to take 10 weeks to complete based on the current progress and remaining work.
