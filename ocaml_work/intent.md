# OCaml DSL Intent and Effect System Refactoring

## Important Note
**No Backwards Compatibility**: This refactoring prioritizes clean, concise, elegant code over backwards compatibility. We will not include migration code or compatibility layers. The goal is a simplified, streamlined implementation that matches the Rust architecture exactly.

## Overview
This work plan refactors the OCaml DSL in `ml_causality` to mirror the simplified Intent and Effect structures implemented in the Rust codebase (as described in `work/intent.md`). The goal is to align the OCaml types with the cleaner Rust architecture that separates hard constraints (`expression`) from soft preferences (`hint`).

## Current State Analysis

### Current OCaml Intent Structure (in `ml_causality/lib/types/types.ml`)
```ocaml
and intent = {
  id: entity_id; 
  name: str_t; 
  domain_id: domain_id; 
  priority: int;
  inputs: resource_flow list;
  outputs: resource_flow list;
  expression: expr_id option; 
  timestamp: timestamp;
  (* Phase 6 optimization enhancements - TO BE REMOVED *)
  optimization_hint: expr_id option;
  compatibility_metadata: effect_compatibility list;
  resource_preferences: resource_preference list;
  target_typed_domain: typed_domain option;
  process_dataflow_hint: process_dataflow_initiation_hint option;
}
```

### Current OCaml Effect Structure  
```ocaml
and effect = {
  id: entity_id; 
  name: str_t; 
  domain_id: domain_id; 
  effect_type: str_t; 
  inputs: resource_flow list;
  outputs: resource_flow list;
  expression: expr_id option; 
  timestamp: timestamp; 
  (* TO BE REMOVED - runtime/instance-specific fields *)
  resources: resource_flow list; 
  nullifiers: resource_flow list; 
  scoped_by: handler_id; 
  intent_id: expr_id option;
  source_typed_domain: typed_domain;
  target_typed_domain: typed_domain;
  originating_dataflow_instance: entity_id option;
}
```

### Target OCaml Structures (to match Rust)
```ocaml
and intent = {
  id: entity_id;
  name: str_t;
  domain_id: domain_id;
  priority: int;  (* Changed from int to match Rust u32 semantics *)
  inputs: resource_flow list;
  outputs: resource_flow list;
  expression: expr_id option;  (* Hard constraints *)
  timestamp: timestamp;
  hint: expr_id option;        (* NEW: Soft preferences *)
}

and effect = {
  id: entity_id;
  name: str_t;
  domain_id: domain_id;
  effect_type: str_t;
  inputs: resource_flow list;
  outputs: resource_flow list;
  expression: expr_id option;  (* Hard constraints/core logic *)
  timestamp: timestamp;
  hint: expr_id option;        (* NEW: Soft preferences *)
}
```

## Rationale and Benefits

### Why This Refactoring is Important

1. **Consistency with Rust Implementation**: Ensures the OCaml DSL and Rust runtime speak the same "language" for Intent and Effect structures.

2. **Simplified Mental Model**: The separation of hard constraints (`expression`) vs soft preferences (`hint`) makes the system easier to understand and reason about.

3. **Better Optimization Framework**: The unified `hint` field provides a clean interface for optimization strategies without cluttering the core type definitions.

4. **Improved Maintainability**: Removing complex, overlapping optimization fields reduces the cognitive load for developers and simplifies the codebase.

5. **Future-Proofing**: The cleaner structure makes it easier to add new optimization strategies and features without further complicating the type system.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Cleaner OCaml codebase** with types that directly mirror the Rust implementation
- **Improved cross-language serialization** and interoperability
- **Better optimization infrastructure** through the unified hint system
- **Enhanced developer experience** with simpler, more intuitive type definitions
- **Reduced maintenance burden** through elimination of redundant fields

## Dependencies

This refactoring depends on:
- The completed Rust Intent/Effect refactoring (already done)
- Current OCaml DSL codebase (exists)
- SSZ serialization bridge (may need updates)
- Understanding of the optimization runtime system

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2** (Core Type Refactoring): 2-3 days
- **Phase 3** (DSL Updates): 3-4 days  
- **Phase 4** (Pattern Matching): 2-3 days
- **Phase 5** (Tests and Examples): 2-3 days
- **Phase 6** (Integration): 2-3 days
- **Phase 7** (Documentation): 1-2 days
- **Phase 8** (Final Integration): 1-2 days

**Total Estimated Time**: 13-20 days

This refactoring represents a significant but necessary improvement to align the OCaml DSL with the cleaner Rust architecture, ultimately benefiting the entire Causality framework.
