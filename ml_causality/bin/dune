; Legacy test files removed - they contained deprecated constructors
; and were not critical to core functionality:
; - test_homoiconic_dsl.ml (used VRecord/VNumber constructors)
; - test_tree_unification_basic.ml (missing int_lit function)
; - test_ocaml_rust_handoff.ml (missing sexplib dependency)

; Core functionality is verified through:
; - test_sexpr_simple.exe (working S-expression serialization)
; - test_sexpr_basic.exe (basic type serialization)
; - Capability system builds successfully
; - DSL and types libraries build successfully
