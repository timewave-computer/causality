Implementation Summary
----------------------
We have successfully implemented domain-specific effects for EVM, CosmWasm, and ZK/Succinct blockchains. The implementation includes:

1. EVM-specific effects:
   - Contract call effects
   - State query effects
   - Gas estimation effects

2. CosmWasm-specific effects:
   - Contract execution effects
   - Contract query effects
   - Contract instantiation effects
   - Code upload effects

3. ZK/Succinct-specific effects:
   - Proof generation effects
   - Proof verification effects
   - Witness creation effects
   - Proof composition effects

We have successfully completed Phase 4 of our implementation plan and are ready to move on to cross-domain operations in Phase 5.
