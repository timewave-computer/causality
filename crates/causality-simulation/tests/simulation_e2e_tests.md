# End-to-End Simulation Tests for Causality System

This document outlines four end-to-end tests designed to validate the critical functionality of the Causality system using the simulation framework. Each test focuses on a different aspect of the system, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the core components and their interactions.

## Test 1: Multi-Domain Fact Observation and Effect Propagation

### Purpose
Verify that facts can be observed across multiple domains and that effects based on these facts are correctly propagated and applied throughout the system.

### Test Scenario
1. Set up a simulation with three mock domains: `DomainA`, `DomainB`, and an in-memory domain
2. Configure observers in each domain to monitor specific resources
3. Generate a fact (e.g., state change or price update) in `DomainA`
4. Observe and validate the fact propagation to other domains
5. Trigger an effect (e.g., resource transfer) based on the observed fact
6. Verify that the effect is correctly applied and recorded in the log
7. Confirm causal relationships are maintained between the fact and effect

### Expected Outcomes
- Fact observation is correctly logged with proper timestamps and domain information
- The effect references the observed fact in its `FactSnapshot`
- Log entries are properly content-addressed and can be verified
- Temporal consistency is maintained across domains
- The state change resulting from the effect is correctly applied in all relevant domains

## Test 2: Log Replay and State Reconstruction

### Purpose
Validate that the entire state of the system can be reconstructed by replaying the log entries, confirming the deterministic nature of the system.

### Test Scenario
1. Initialize a clean simulation environment with multiple mock domains
2. Generate a series of facts and effects across the mock domains
3. Create checkpoints at specific intervals
4. Shut down the simulation
5. Restart with a clean state, using only the log entries
6. Replay the log from the beginning to the latest checkpoint
7. Continue replay to the latest entry
8. Compare the reconstructed state with the original state

### Expected Outcomes
- The replayed state exactly matches the original state at each checkpoint
- The final reconstructed state is identical to the original final state
- Replay correctly handles different entry types (facts, effects, events)
- The replay engine correctly processes time-dependent operations
- Log verification functions correctly identify any tampering with log entries

## Test 3: Capability-Based Security and Authorization

### Purpose
Test the capability-based security model, ensuring that operations require proper authorization and that capability delegation works correctly.

### Test Scenario
1. Set up a simulation with multiple agents with different capability sets
2. Configure resources that require specific capabilities to access
3. Attempt operations with and without the required capabilities
4. Delegate capabilities from one agent to another
5. Verify operations with delegated capabilities
6. Revoke capabilities and attempt previously successful operations
7. Test capability attenuation during delegation

### Expected Outcomes
- Operations without proper capabilities are rejected
- Operations with proper capabilities succeed
- Capability delegation creates valid authorization chains
- Delegated capabilities correctly grant access to resources
- Attenuated capabilities have reduced permissions compared to their source
- Revoked capabilities no longer authorize operations
- The system maintains a complete audit trail of capability usage

## Test 4: Cross-Domain Effect Composition and Consistency

### Purpose
Verify that complex, multi-step operations across different mock domains maintain consistency and correct sequencing.

### Test Scenario
1. Set up a simulation with multiple mock domains (`DomainA`, `DomainB`, and `DomainC`)
2. Define a complex operation that involves:
   - Reading a resource from `DomainA`
   - Creating a derived resource in `DomainB`
   - Updating a related resource in `DomainC`
3. Execute the operation with proper sequencing
4. Monitor the state changes across all domains
5. Introduce a simulated failure in one of the steps
6. Verify error handling and state consistency
7. Test the operation with parallel execution where possible

### Expected Outcomes
- The complex operation is correctly decomposed into individual effects
- Effects are correctly sequenced and dependencies are maintained
- The system maintains a consistent state across domains
- Errors in one step are properly handled and reported
- The log accurately records all steps, including error handling
- The system's final state correctly reflects the outcome of the operation
- Parallel execution optimizations work correctly where dependencies allow

These tests provide comprehensive coverage of the critical functionality of the Causality system, focusing on the core principles of content addressing, causal consistency, explicit fact observations, and capability-based security. They use mock domains instead of actual blockchain integrations, allowing for thorough testing of the system architecture and behavior without external dependencies.
