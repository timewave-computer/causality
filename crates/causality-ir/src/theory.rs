/// 
/// TEL forms a symmetric monoidal category where:
/// - The tensor product ⊗ corresponds to parallel composition
/// - Sequential composition forms the category composition
/// - The unit object I corresponds to the identity effect
/// 
/// This category provides a computational model for temporal effects.
