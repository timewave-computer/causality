# Causality Resource Management System

## Overview

The Resource Management System provides a comprehensive framework for managing resources across domain and effect boundaries in the Causality framework. It consists of several key components that work together to ensure proper access control, lifecycle management, resource locking, dependency tracking, and capability integration.

## Key Components

### Resource Access Control

The access control component manages how resources are accessed, providing mechanisms to track and control resource usage:

- **Resource access types**: Read, Write, Execute, Lock, Transfer
- **Access tracking**: Records all resource accesses with effect and domain information
- **Locking detection**: Identifies when resources are locked by effects

### Resource Lifecycle Management

The lifecycle component manages the state transitions of resources:

- **Lifecycle events**: Created, Activated, Locked, Unlocked, Frozen, Unfrozen, Consumed, Archived
- **State management**: Ensures resources transition correctly between states
- **Audit trail**: Maintains a complete history of resource state changes

### Cross-Domain Resource Locking

The locking component provides mechanisms for securing resources across domain boundaries:

- **Distributed locks**: Exclusive, Shared, and Intent locks
- **Deadlock prevention**: Timeouts and rollback mechanisms
- **Transaction support**: Locks can be tied to transaction IDs

### Resource Dependency Tracking

The dependency component tracks relationships between resources:

- **Dependency types**: Strong, Weak, Temporal, Data, Identity
- **Cross-domain dependencies**: Track dependencies between resources in different domains
- **Dependency management**: Add, remove, and query dependencies

### Resource Capability Integration

The capability component integrates the resource management system with the unified capability system:

- **Resource-specific capabilities**: Access, lifecycle, locking, and dependency capabilities
- **Capability verification**: Verify that operations have required capabilities
- **Capability caching**: Cache capability checks for performance

### Cross-Domain Resource Effects

Pre-built effects for common cross-domain resource operations:

- **Resource transfer**: Transfer resources between domains
- **Distributed locking**: Lock resources across multiple domains
- **Dependency management**: Establish dependencies between resources in different domains

## Implementation Details

- All components use **content addressing** for resource identification
- Thread-safe implementation with `RwLock` and `Mutex` for concurrent access
- Asynchronous interfaces for capability checking and effect execution
- Explicit error handling with detailed error types
- Comprehensive testing with unit tests for each component
- Example code showing how to use each component

## Demos and Examples

### Shell Script Demo
A shell script is available at `scripts/resource_management_demo.sh` that demonstrates the functionality of the resource management system.

### Example Binaries
You can run specific resource management examples with:
```
cargo run --example resource_examples [access|lifecycle|locking|dependency|integrated|cross-domain|all]
```

### Performance Benchmarks
The system includes performance benchmarks that can be run with:
```
cargo bench --bench resource_benchmarks
```

These benchmarks measure the performance of:
- Resource lifecycle operations
- Resource access control
- Resource locking
- Resource dependency management
- Implementation overhead

## Documentation

- Detailed documentation on each component in `docs/src/concepts/resources/resource_management.md`
- API documentation for each component's public interface
- Example code and best practices

## Integration with Causality Framework

The Resource Management System integrates with other parts of the Causality framework:

- **Domain System**: Resources can be domain-specific and accessed across domains
- **Effect System**: Effects can operate on resources and require appropriate capabilities
- **Capability System**: The unified capability system governs access to resources

## Best Practices

1. **Explicit Access Control**: Always use the access control system to record resource access
2. **Proper Lifecycle Management**: Track resource lifecycle events for auditing and state management
3. **Cross-Domain Coordination**: Use locking mechanisms when resources are accessed across domains
4. **Dependency Management**: Track resource dependencies to maintain consistency
5. **Capability-Based Authorization**: Use the capability system to authorize resource operations
6. **Use Cross-Domain Effects**: Leverage pre-built cross-domain effects for common operations
7. **Transaction Boundaries**: Define clear transaction boundaries for cross-domain operations
