// crates/causality-lisp/src/dsl/types.rs
// This file is intentionally kept simple as the DSL primarily works with
// `causality_types::expr::ast::Expr` directly.

// If a module-local alias for `causality_types::expr::ast::Expr` is desired
// for use within other `dsl` submodules (builders, serializer), it could be defined here:
// pub use causality_types::expr::ast::Expr as DslAstExpr;
