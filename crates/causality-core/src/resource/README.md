# Causality Resource System

The Resource System is a core component of the Causality platform that provides a unified way to model, manage, and operate on resources across different domains.

## Core Components

### Resource Type Registry

The Resource Type Registry provides a content-addressed registry for resource types in the Causality system. It enables:

- **Type Definition**: Define resource types with schemas, versioning, and capability requirements
- **Content Addressing**: Uniquely identify and retrieve resource types based on their content hash
- **Compatibility Checking**: Determine if different resource types or versions are compatible
- **Schema Validation**: Validate resources against their type schemas

Key features:
- Content-addressed type definitions ensure immutability and consistent identification
- Versioning support with semantic version parsing and comparison
- Capability-based access control integration for resource operations
- Schema validation to ensure resource integrity

### Resource Operations

Resources can be operated on through a standard set of operations:
- **Create**: Instantiate a new resource of a specific type
- **Read**: Retrieve resource data based on its identifier
- **Update**: Modify an existing resource
- **Delete**: Remove a resource from the system
- **Transfer**: Move a resource between owners or domains

### Resource Capabilities

Operations on resources are authorized through capabilities:
- Each resource type defines capability requirements for different operations
- The capability system ensures that only authorized agents can perform operations
- Capabilities can be granted, revoked, and delegated

## Implementation

The Resource Type Registry is implemented with the following components:

- **ResourceTypeId**: Unique identifier for resource types, including name, namespace, version, and content hash
- **ResourceSchema**: Schema definition for validating resources of a specific type
- **ResourceTypeDefinition**: Complete definition of a resource type
- **ResourceTypeRegistry**: Interface for registering and retrieving resource types
- **ContentAddressedResourceTypeRegistry**: Implementation backed by content-addressed storage

## Integration with Effect System

The Resource System integrates closely with the Effect System:

- Effects operate on resources through capability-checked operations
- The Resource Type Registry ensures that effects can only operate on compatible resources
- Resource modifications are tracked through the effect execution history

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements to the Resource System include:
- Cross-domain resource protocol for secure resource transfer between domains
- Resource type versioning with automatic migration
- Resource storage adapter for different storage backends
- Resource indexing for efficient queries
- Resource reference protocol for secure resource references
