# Causality DB

This crate provides concrete database implementations for the Causality system, often building upon the abstractions defined in `causality-storage`.

## Purpose

Focuses on integrating specific database technologies and providing robust, performant persistence layers.

Responsibilities typically include:

- **RocksDB Implementation**: Providing a storage backend based on RocksDB, including configuration, management, and potentially optimized access patterns.
- **Other DB Implementations**: Potentially housing implementations for other database systems if needed (e.g., SQL databases, other NoSQL stores).
- **Transaction Management**: Handling database-specific transaction logic.
- **Schema Management**: Managing database schemas and migrations if applicable.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing database interactions for specific workloads within Causality.

This crate allows the rest of the system to interact with databases through potentially abstract interfaces (from `causality-storage` or defined here) while encapsulating the complexities of the specific database technology.
