//! Mock Client Tests
//!
//! This module tests the mock implementation of blockchain clients.
//! These tests don't depend on any external blockchain clients.

// Simple compile-time check
#[test]

    // This test doesn't actually test any mock client functionality
    // It just verifies that the test file compiles correctly
    println!("Mock client tests compile successfully!");
