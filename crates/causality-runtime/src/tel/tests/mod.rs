// Purpose: Declares test modules for the TEL subsystem.

// Note: interpreter_tests and lisp_host_env_tests have been temporarily removed
// due to outdated API usage. They need to be updated to use the unified types.

// Active test modules with current API compatibility
// (none currently - all tests need updating for unified types)
