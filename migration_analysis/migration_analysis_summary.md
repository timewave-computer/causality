# ResourceRegister Migration Analysis Summary

Generated on Sun Mar 23 19:02:32 CST 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes findings from multiple analysis scripts to assist with migrating from separate Resource/Register abstractions to the unified ResourceRegister model as specified in ADR-021.

## Creation Pattern Analysis

Found approximately 47 instances of resource/register creation patterns that need migration.

See [Creation Patterns Report](creation_patterns_report.md) for details.
## Update Pattern Analysis

Found approximately 59 instances of resource/register update patterns that need migration.

See [Update Patterns Report](update_patterns_report.md) for details.
## Transfer Pattern Analysis

Found approximately 255 instances of cross-domain transfer patterns that need migration.

See [Transfer Patterns Report](transfer_patterns_report.md) for details.
## Redundant Code Analysis

Identified approximately 0
0 files that could be removed or consolidated after migration.

See [Redundant Code Report](redundant_code_report.md) for details.
## Migration Checklist Recommendations

Based on the analysis, these additional items should be added to the migration checklist:

### Creation Pattern Migration

- [ ] Replace  calls with 
- [ ] Replace dual creation (, ) with unified pattern
- [ ] Update factory methods to return  instances

### Update Pattern Migration

- [ ] Replace  mutation patterns with direct updates to 
- [ ] Replace dual updates (, ) with unified storage effects
- [ ] Consolidate resource and register update validation logic

### Transfer Pattern Migration

- [ ] Replace  with 
- [ ] Update cross-domain operations to use unified storage effects
- [ ] Remove separate consumption operations in favor of atomic transfers

### Code Cleanup After Migration

- [ ] Remove redundant conversion functions (, )
- [ ] Delete synchronization code between resources and registers
- [ ] Consolidate error types and error handling
- [ ] Remove redundant files once migration is complete

## Estimated Migration Effort

Based on pattern analysis, approximately 361 code locations will need modifications to complete the migration.
