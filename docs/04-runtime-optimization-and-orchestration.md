# Runtime Optimization and Orchestration

The Causality framework employs sophisticated optimization strategies to efficiently execute Intents and manage resource allocation across different execution domains. The optimization system balances multiple competing objectives including execution latency, resource utilization efficiency, and computational costs while maintaining the declarative nature of Intent specification.

## Optimization Strategy Framework

The framework implements multiple optimization strategies that can be selected based on application requirements and system constraints. Each strategy represents a different approach to balancing the trade-offs inherent in distributed resource management and computation.

Capital efficiency optimization focuses on maximizing the utilization of available resources while minimizing waste. This strategy prioritizes resource reuse, efficient allocation patterns, and minimization of idle resources. The approach proves particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments where optimal utilization directly impacts system performance.

Latency optimization prioritizes rapid Intent execution and minimal response times. This strategy may accept higher resource costs or less efficient resource utilization in exchange for faster completion times. The approach suits interactive applications and time-sensitive computational workflows.

Cost minimization strategies focus on reducing the overall computational and resource expenses associated with Intent execution. These strategies may accept longer execution times or more complex orchestration in exchange for lower operational costs. The approach benefits batch processing workloads and cost-sensitive applications.

Balanced optimization attempts to find optimal trade-offs across all optimization dimensions. Rather than optimizing for a single metric, balanced strategies seek solutions that provide reasonable performance across latency, cost, and resource utilization metrics.

## Strategy Implementation

The optimization strategies are implemented through configurable parameters that weight different optimization objectives. Each strategy defines specific weightings for priority, latency, and cost considerations, enabling fine-tuned control over optimization behavior.

```rust
pub struct OptimizationStrategy {
    pub name: Str,
    pub description: Str,
    pub priority_weight: f64,
    pub latency_weight: f64,
    pub cost_weight: f64,
}
```

The CapitalEfficiencyStrategy emphasizes resource utilization with high priority weighting and moderate consideration for latency and cost factors. This configuration drives the optimizer toward solutions that make efficient use of available resources even if they require more complex orchestration.

LatencyOptimizationStrategy reverses these priorities, emphasizing rapid execution over resource efficiency or cost considerations. The strategy accepts higher resource usage and costs in exchange for minimized execution time.

CostMinimizationStrategy prioritizes economic efficiency, seeking solutions that minimize computational and resource expenses. This approach may result in longer execution times or more complex resource management but achieves lower operational costs.

## Effect Cost Modeling

The framework employs sophisticated cost models to estimate the resource requirements and expenses associated with different execution strategies. These models consider computational complexity, resource consumption, domain-specific costs, and orchestration overhead.

```rust
pub struct EffectCostModel {
    pub base_cost: u64,
    pub resource_cost_per_unit: u64,
    pub complexity_multiplier: f64,
    pub domain_cost_factor: f64,
    pub estimated_duration_ms: u64,
}
```

Base costs represent the fundamental expense of executing an Effect regardless of its specific parameters or resource requirements. These costs account for system overhead, initialization expenses, and minimum resource allocation requirements.

Resource costs scale with the quantity and type of resources involved in the Effect execution. Different resource types may have different cost factors based on their scarcity, computational requirements, or external service dependencies.

Complexity multipliers adjust costs based on the computational complexity of the Effect logic. Simple transformations receive lower multipliers while complex computations or multi-step processes receive higher multipliers that reflect their increased resource requirements.

Domain cost factors account for the varying expenses associated with different execution environments. Verifiable domains may have higher costs due to proof generation requirements, while service domains may have costs related to external API usage.

## Resource Usage Estimation

Resource usage estimation provides predictive models for the computational and storage resources required for Intent execution. These estimates enable proactive resource allocation and help prevent resource exhaustion during execution.

```rust
pub struct ResourceUsageEstimate {
    pub cpu_time_ms: u64,
    pub memory_bytes: u64,
    pub storage_bytes: u64,
    pub network_bytes: u64,
    pub estimated_completion_time: Timestamp,
}
```

CPU time estimates predict the computational requirements for Effect execution, enabling scheduling decisions and resource allocation planning. These estimates consider both the direct computational requirements and any overhead associated with orchestration and coordination.

Memory usage estimates help prevent memory exhaustion and enable appropriate resource allocation for Effect execution. The estimates include both working memory requirements and any persistent storage needs during execution.

Storage estimates predict the long-term storage requirements for Effect results and intermediate state. These estimates support capacity planning and help ensure adequate storage resources are available.

Network usage estimates account for data transfer requirements, particularly important for cross-domain Effects or those involving external service integration. These estimates help optimize network resource allocation and predict bandwidth requirements.

## Process Dataflow Orchestration

The framework supports complex multi-step workflows through process dataflow orchestration capabilities. While the `DataflowBlock` (described in `03-lisp-interpreter-and-dsl.md`) details the execution structure for a set of concrete effects within a single transaction, the `ProcessDataflowDefinition` is a higher-level, declarative `Resource` that defines a template for complex, multi-step, and potentially multi-domain workflows. These are not static execution graphs themselves but are interpreted and managed by `Handler` Lisp expressions.

### `ProcessDataflowDefinition` Structure with Type-Safe Schemas

A `ProcessDataflowDefinition` leverages Rust's type system for automatic schema generation:

```rust
pub struct ProcessDataflowDefinition<I, O, S> 
where
    I: Clone + PartialEq + TypeSchema,
    O: Clone + PartialEq + TypeSchema,
    S: Clone + PartialEq + TypeSchema,
{
    pub definition_id: ExprId,
    pub name: Str,
    pub nodes: Vec<ProcessDataflowNode>,
    pub edges: Vec<ProcessDataflowEdge>,
    pub default_typed_domain: TypedDomain,
    // _marker: PhantomData<(I, O, S)>, // To use I, O, S if not directly in fields
}
```
*(Note: The `_marker` field might be needed if I, O, S are not used in other fields to satisfy the compiler, or alternatively, methods can use them.)*

**Key Innovation: Automatic Schema Generation**

Instead of manually defining string-based schemas (which are error-prone and can become inconsistent), schemas are automatically derived from the type parameters:

-   **Input Schema (`I`)**: Automatically generated `TypeExpr` from the input type parameter using `#[derive(TypeSchema)]`.
-   **Output Schema (`O`)**: Automatically generated `TypeExpr` from the output type parameter.
-   **State Schema (`S`)**: Automatically generated `TypeExpr` from the state type parameter.

```rust
// Schemas are automatically generated at compile-time
// (Conceptual example, actual API may differ)
// let input_schema = ProcessDataflowDefinition::<MyInput, MyOutput, MyState>::input_schema();
// let output_schema = ProcessDataflowDefinition::<MyInput, MyOutput, MyState>::output_schema();
// let state_schema = ProcessDataflowDefinition::<MyInput, MyOutput, MyState>::state_schema();
```

**Benefits of Automatic Schema Generation:**

1.  **Type Safety**: Impossible to have schema/type mismatches.
2.  **No Manual Maintenance**: Schemas automatically update when types change.
3.  **Content Addressing**: Deterministic schema IDs through consistent `TypeExpr` serialization.
4.  **Cross-Domain Compatibility**: Schemas are verifiable by content hash.
5.  **IDE Support**: Full IntelliSense and compile-time validation.
6.  **Generic Support**: Works seamlessly with generic types and complex nested structures.

### ProcessDataflowNode Structure

Process nodes define the computational steps within a workflow:

-   `id`: Unique identifier for the node within this `ProcessDataflowDefinition`.
-   `node_type`: Indicates the nature of the node (e.g., `Action`, `ConditionalChoice`, `SubDataflowInvocation`, `Start`, `End`).
-   `action_template`: If `node_type` is `Action`, this contains an `Effect` template with placeholders for parameters derived from the dataflow's state or inputs. The `Handler` will instantiate this template to create a concrete `Effect`.
-   `condition_expr_id`: If `node_type` is `ConditionalChoice` (or for conditional transitions), this is an `ExpressionId` pointing to a Lisp expression that the `Handler` evaluates to determine the next step.
-   `target_domain_policy`: Specifies how the `TypedDomain` for any emitted `Effect`s should be determined (e.g., inherit from the orchestrating `Handler`, specified as a parameter, or fixed in the template).
-   `sub_dataflow_id`: If `node_type` is `SubDataflowInvocation`, this references another `ProcessDataflowDefinition`'s `definition_id`.

### Orchestration by Handlers

`Handler`s are responsible for orchestrating `ProcessDataflowDefinition` instances. The `dynamic_expr` (Lisp code) within a `Handler` uses a set of specialized combinators to interact with `ProcessDataflowDefinition`s and manage their instances. This typically involves:

1.  **Loading Definition**: Fetching the `ProcessDataflowDefinition` (e.g., `(get-dataflow-definition df_id)`).
2.  **State Management**: Creating or updating the state `Resource` for a dataflow instance (e.g., `(update-dataflow-instance-state df_instance_id new_state_value_expr)`).
3.  **Schema Validation**: Runtime validation against automatically generated schemas (e.g., `(validate-input-against-schema input_data dataflow_def)`).
4.  **Evaluating Conditions**: Executing Lisp expressions defined in nodes or edges to make decisions (e.g., `(evaluate-gating-condition condition_expr_id context_value_expr)`).
5.  **Instantiating Effects**: Creating concrete `Effect`s from `action_template`s within `ProcessNode`s, populating them with data from the instance's state or inputs (e.g., `(instantiate-effect-from-node effect_node_template params_value_expr)`).
6.  **Emitting Effects**: Sending the instantiated `Effect`s to the appropriate `TypedDomain` for execution (e.g., `(emit-effect-on-domain target_domain_id effect_value_expr)`). The `target_domain_id` is determined based on the `target_domain_policy` of the `ProcessNode` and the context of the `Handler`.

This orchestration allows for dynamic and stateful workflow management, where the `ProcessDataflowDefinition` provides the blueprint, and the `Handler` acts as the engine driving the process through its various stages, potentially spanning multiple transactions and interacting with different `TypedDomain`s.

### Schema Generation Implementation

The automatic schema generation system relies on:

1.  **`TypeSchema` trait**: Provides a `type_expr() -> TypeExpr` method (or similar) that returns a structured representation of a type.
2.  **`#[derive(TypeSchema)]` macro**: Automatically implements the `TypeSchema` trait for structs and enums, traversing their fields and variants to build the `TypeExpr`.
3.  **Content-addressed `TypeExprId`s**: The `TypeExpr` itself is SSZ-serializable, and its Merkle root can serve as a deterministic `TypeExprId`, ensuring that identical type structures always yield the same schema ID.
4.  **Cross-language compatibility**: For systems involving multiple languages (e.g., Rust and OCaml), the `TypeExpr` structure is designed to be equivalent or translatable, allowing, for instance, an OCaml DSL to generate or validate against `TypeExpr`s compatible with those generated from Rust.

Example usage (conceptual):

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, TypeSchema)] // Assuming TypeSchema derive macro
pub struct TokenTransferInput {
    pub sender: String,
    pub recipient: String,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub token_type: String,
}

// Assume MyOutput and MyState are also defined and derive TypeSchema
// type TokenTransferFlow = ProcessDataflowDefinition<
//     TokenTransferInput,
//     MyOutput,
//     MyState
// >;

// Schemas are automatically generated and content-addressed
// let schemas = TokenTransferFlow::schemas(); // e.g., a method returning (input_schema, output_schema, state_schema)
```

### Consequences of this Orchestration Model

-   **Type safety is enforced at compile-time** for all dataflow schemas when defining `ProcessDataflowDefinition`s in Rust.
-   **Schema evolution is handled automatically**: Changes to the Rust types `I`, `O`, or `S` will automatically reflect in the generated schemas.
-   **Cross-domain schema compatibility** is ensured through content addressing of `TypeExpr`s, allowing different domains or even different language implementations to verify schema consistency.

## Orchestration Hints and Preferences

The framework provides mechanisms for applications to influence optimization and orchestration decisions without mandating specific implementation approaches. These hints enable applications to express preferences while maintaining the flexibility of the optimization system.

Process dataflow initiation hints provide guidance about preferred execution strategies, resource constraints, and performance requirements. These hints influence optimization decisions without overriding the framework's ability to adapt to changing conditions.

```rust
pub struct ProcessDataflowInitiationHint {
    pub preferred_strategy_id: Str,
    pub priority: u32,
    pub dataflow_definition_id: Option<ResourceId>,
    pub resource_constraints: ResourceUsageEstimate,
    pub domain_preference_order: Vec<TypedDomain>,
    pub prefer_parallel_execution: bool,
    pub max_latency_ms: Option<u64>,
    pub cost_budget: Option<u64>,
}
```

Strategy preferences enable applications to specify their preferred optimization approach while allowing the framework to override these preferences when necessary. The framework considers these preferences alongside system constraints and current resource availability.

Resource constraints provide hard limits on resource usage that the optimization system must respect. These constraints prevent resource exhaustion and ensure that Intent execution remains within acceptable bounds.

Domain preferences specify the preferred order for domain selection when multiple domains could execute the same Intent. The framework considers these preferences alongside domain capabilities and current load when making execution decisions.

## Dynamic Optimization

The optimization system adapts to changing system conditions through dynamic optimization capabilities. These capabilities enable the framework to adjust optimization strategies based on current resource availability, system load, and performance metrics.

Performance monitoring provides real-time feedback about system performance and resource utilization. This information enables the optimization system to detect performance bottlenecks, resource constraints, and opportunities for improvement.

Adaptive strategy selection enables the framework to switch between optimization strategies based on current conditions. During periods of high load, the system might prioritize latency optimization, while during low-load periods it might focus on cost minimization.

Load balancing capabilities distribute Intent execution across available resources and domains to prevent bottlenecks and ensure optimal resource utilization. The load balancing system considers both current load and predicted future demand when making distribution decisions.

## Integration with Domain System

The optimization system integrates closely with the framework's domain system to make informed decisions about where and how to execute Intents. Different domains provide different capabilities and performance characteristics that influence optimization decisions.

Domain capability assessment evaluates the suitability of different domains for specific Intent types. This assessment considers computational capabilities, resource availability, security requirements, and integration capabilities when making domain selection decisions.

Cross-domain optimization enables the framework to orchestrate workflows that span multiple domains while maintaining optimal performance. The system considers the costs and benefits of cross-domain communication when designing execution strategies.

Domain-specific optimization strategies can be implemented to take advantage of unique domain capabilities or address domain-specific constraints. These strategies enable fine-tuned optimization for specialized execution environments.

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation provides basic optimization strategy definitions with configurable parameters for different optimization objectives. The cost modeling system includes fundamental cost estimation capabilities with support for resource-based cost calculations.

Resource usage estimation provides basic predictive capabilities for computational and storage requirements. The system includes support for process dataflow definitions and orchestration hints that enable complex workflow specification.

Future development will focus on dynamic optimization capabilities, advanced cost modeling, and sophisticated orchestration strategies that can adapt to changing system conditions and requirements.
