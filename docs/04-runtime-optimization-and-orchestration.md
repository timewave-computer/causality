# Runtime Optimization and Orchestration

The Causality framework employs sophisticated optimization strategies to efficiently execute Intents and manage resource allocation across different execution domains. Building on the three-layer architecture, the optimization system operates primarily at **Layer 2 (Intentional Programs & Effect Logic)**, using structured hints to guide execution while maintaining correctness guarantees. The system balances multiple competing objectives including execution latency, resource utilization efficiency, and computational costs while preserving the declarative nature of Intent specification.

## Architectural Context

The runtime optimization system integrates with:

- **Layer 0 (Core Computational Substrate)**: Execution ultimately compiles to the nine-instruction register machine, where computational costs are precisely measured
- **Layer 1 (Structured Types)**: Row types and linearity constraints inform optimization decisions and ensure type-safe transformations
- **Layer 2 (Effect System)**: Effects with pre/post conditions and structured hints form the optimization space

The optimization framework respects the **handler/interpreter separation**:
- **Pure Handlers**: Transform effects for optimization without side effects
- **Stateful Interpreter**: Executes optimized effects while managing resources

## Optimization Strategy Framework

The framework implements multiple optimization strategies that can be selected based on application requirements and system constraints. Each strategy represents a different approach to balancing the trade-offs inherent in distributed resource management and computation.

Capital efficiency optimization focuses on maximizing the utilization of available resources while minimizing waste. This strategy prioritizes resource reuse, efficient allocation patterns, and minimization of idle resources. The approach proves particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments where optimal utilization directly impacts system performance.

Latency optimization prioritizes rapid Intent execution and minimal response times. This strategy may accept higher resource costs or less efficient resource utilization in exchange for faster completion times. The approach suits interactive applications and time-sensitive computational workflows.

Cost minimization strategies focus on reducing the overall computational and resource expenses associated with Intent execution. These strategies may accept longer execution times or more complex orchestration in exchange for lower operational costs. The approach benefits batch processing workloads and cost-sensitive applications.

Balanced optimization attempts to find optimal trade-offs across all optimization dimensions. Rather than optimizing for a single metric, balanced strategies seek solutions that provide reasonable performance across latency, cost, and resource utilization metrics.

## Strategy Implementation

The optimization strategies are implemented through configurable parameters that weight different optimization objectives. Each strategy defines specific weightings for priority, latency, and cost considerations, enabling fine-tuned control over optimization behavior.

```rust
pub struct OptimizationStrategy {
    pub name: Str,
    pub description: Str,
    pub priority_weight: f64,
    pub latency_weight: f64,
    pub cost_weight: f64,
}
```

The CapitalEfficiencyStrategy emphasizes resource utilization with high priority weighting and moderate consideration for latency and cost factors. This configuration drives the optimizer toward solutions that make efficient use of available resources even if they require more complex orchestration.

LatencyOptimizationStrategy reverses these priorities, emphasizing rapid execution over resource efficiency or cost considerations. The strategy accepts higher resource usage and costs in exchange for minimized execution time.

CostMinimizationStrategy prioritizes economic efficiency, seeking solutions that minimize computational and resource expenses. This approach may result in longer execution times or more complex resource management but achieves lower operational costs.

## Effect Cost Modeling

The framework employs sophisticated cost models to estimate the resource requirements and expenses associated with different execution strategies. These models integrate with the formal Effect structure, which includes pre-conditions, post-conditions, and optimization hints.

### Effect Structure Integration

Effects in Layer 2 are defined with:
```lisp
;; Effect⟨α⟩ = {
;;   tag: Symbol,
;;   params: α,                               
;;   pre: Constraint,                         
;;   post: Constraint,
;;   hints: [Hint]                           
;; }
```

The cost model leverages this structure to make informed optimization decisions:

```rust
pub struct EffectCostModel {
    pub base_cost: u64,                    // Base cost for effect type
    pub resource_cost_per_unit: u64,       // Cost per resource unit
    pub complexity_multiplier: f64,        // Based on pre/post conditions
    pub domain_cost_factor: f64,           // Domain-specific costs
    pub estimated_duration_ms: u64,        // From effect hints
    pub hint_adjustments: HintCostFactors, // Cost adjustments from hints
}

pub struct HintCostFactors {
    pub batching_discount: f64,            // Reduction when BatchWith hint is used
    pub latency_premium: f64,              // Extra cost for Minimize(latency)
    pub domain_routing_cost: f64,          // Cost for PreferDomain/RequireDomain
}
```

### Cost Calculation with Hints

The optimization system interprets effect hints to adjust cost calculations:

- **BatchWith(selector)**: Reduces per-effect cost when multiple effects can be batched
- **Minimize(latency)**: May increase resource allocation to reduce execution time
- **PreferDomain(domain)**: Influences domain selection costs
- **Deadline(timestamp)**: Creates time-based cost penalties

Base costs represent the fundamental expense of executing an Effect regardless of its specific parameters or resource requirements. These costs account for system overhead, initialization expenses, and minimum resource allocation requirements.

Resource costs scale with the quantity and type of resources involved in the Effect execution. Different resource types may have different cost factors based on their scarcity, computational requirements, or external service dependencies.

Complexity multipliers now consider the computational complexity of verifying pre-conditions and ensuring post-conditions. Complex constraint verification increases the multiplier to reflect higher computational requirements.

Domain cost factors account for the varying expenses associated with different execution environments. Verifiable domains may have higher costs due to proof generation requirements, while service domains may have costs related to external API usage.

## Resource Usage Estimation

Resource usage estimation provides predictive models for the computational and storage resources required for Intent execution. These estimates enable proactive resource allocation and help prevent resource exhaustion during execution.

```rust
pub struct ResourceUsageEstimate {
    pub cpu_time_ms: u64,
    pub memory_bytes: u64,
    pub storage_bytes: u64,
    pub network_bytes: u64,
    pub estimated_completion_time: Timestamp,
}
```

CPU time estimates predict the computational requirements for Effect execution, enabling scheduling decisions and resource allocation planning. These estimates consider both the direct computational requirements and any overhead associated with orchestration and coordination.

Memory usage estimates help prevent memory exhaustion and enable appropriate resource allocation for Effect execution. The estimates include both working memory requirements and any persistent storage needs during execution.

Storage estimates predict the long-term storage requirements for Effect results and intermediate state. These estimates support capacity planning and help ensure adequate storage resources are available.

Network usage estimates account for data transfer requirements, particularly important for cross-domain Effects or those involving external service integration. These estimates help optimize network resource allocation and predict bandwidth requirements.

## Complex Workflow Orchestration

The framework supports complex multi-step workflows through several architectural components that work together to provide flexible, declarative orchestration:

### Temporal Effect Graph (TEG) Based Orchestration

The Temporal Effect Graph (TEG) is a Layer 2 data structure that provides a powerful model for representing and managing complex, causally-linked computational workflows. It is a directed graph where nodes represent effects and edges represent the dependencies between them.

#### TEG Nodes: `EffectNode`

Each primary node in the TEG is an `EffectNode`, encapsulating a single `Effect` and its context within the workflow. An `EffectNode` typically includes:

*   **`id`**: A unique identifier for the node within the TEG.
*   **`effect`**: The actual Layer 2 `Effect` data structure (containing its `name`, `domain_id`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `expression`, `timestamp`, `hint`, etc.).
*   **`pre_conditions`**: A set of Layer 2 `Constraint`s that must be satisfied before this effect can be considered for execution.
*   **`post_conditions`**: A set of Layer 2 `Constraint`s that are expected to hold after this effect successfully completes.
*   **`status`**: The current execution state of the effect (e.g., `Pending`, `Ready`, `Executing`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`).
*   **`hints`**: Additional optimization or scheduling `Hint`s specific to this node's execution, potentially augmenting or overriding hints from the underlying `Effect`.
*   **`result`**: The outcome or output values produced upon successful execution of the effect.

```lisp
;; Conceptual structure of an EffectNode (details in Rust structs)
(effect-node
  :id "node-001"
  :effect (Transfer :from acc1 :to acc2 :amount 100) ;; The Effect data
  :pre_conditions [(IsActive acc1) (HasSufficientFunds acc1 100)]
  :post_conditions [(IsUpdated acc2)]
  :status Pending
  :hints [(PreferDomain "domain-A")]
  :result nil)
```

#### TEG Edges: Dependencies and Flows

Directed edges connect `EffectNode`s, representing various types of relationships:

*   **`CausalityLink`**: Represents a direct causal or temporal dependency. For example, Effect A must complete before Effect B can start. These are often derived from `pre_conditions` of one effect matching `post_conditions` of another, or explicit sequencing hints.
*   **`ResourceLink`**: Traces the flow of a specific `Resource` (or a reference to it) from a producing `EffectNode` to a consuming `EffectNode`. These are derived from the `outputs` of one effect matching the `inputs` of another.
*   **`ControlLink`**: Defines conditional execution paths. For example, if `EffectNode` A succeeds, then `EffectNode` B is enabled; if A fails, `EffectNode` C might be enabled. These can be derived from workflow logic or specific control flow hints.

#### TEG Construction and Role

The TEG is dynamically constructed by the Layer 2 runtime, typically from an `Intent` (which specifies a desired state and a set of effects to achieve it) or a collection of related `Effect`s. The graph's structure emerges from:
1.  Analyzing the `inputs` and `outputs` defined in each `Effect` to establish `ResourceLink`s.
2.  Matching `pre_conditions` of effects with `post_conditions` of others to infer `CausalityLink`s.
3.  Interpreting explicit sequencing or control flow `Hint`s.

```lisp
;; Example: Effects that would form part of a TEG
(defeffect ValidateTransfer [transfer-details]
  :outputs [validated-transfer]
  :pre (and (valid-amount? transfer-details) (has-funds? transfer-details.from))
  :post (is-validated validated-transfer))

(defeffect ExecuteTransfer [validated-transfer]
  :inputs [validated-transfer]
  :outputs [transfer-receipt]
  :pre (is-validated validated-transfer) ;; Forms CausalityLink from ValidateTransfer
  :post (is-executed transfer-receipt))

(defeffect GenerateReceipt [transfer-receipt]
  :inputs [transfer-receipt]
  :post (is-receipt-available transfer-receipt))
```

The TEG serves several crucial functions:

-   **Workflow Visualization and Management**: Provides a clear representation of complex processes.
-   **Automated Orchestration**: The runtime can traverse the TEG, automatically determining the correct execution order based on dependencies and current states. This significantly simplifies defining complex workflows, as developers can focus on individual effects and their local conditions.
-   **Parallelism Identification**: By analyzing dependencies, the runtime can identify effects that can be executed in parallel.
-   **Resource Tracking**: `ResourceLink`s provide a clear audit trail for resource lineage and consumption.
-   **Optimization Substrate**: The TEG allows optimizers to analyze and transform workflows (e.g., batching effects, re-routing through different domains, selecting optimal handlers) based on global and local `Hint`s.
-   **Fault Tolerance**: The status of each node and the explicit dependencies allow for more robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and compensation logic.

### Handler Composition for Workflow Logic

Complex orchestration logic is implemented through handler composition:

```lisp
;; Compose handlers to create workflow transformation pipeline
(defhandler payment-workflow : PaymentRequest → CompletedPayment
  (compose
    validate-handler          ;; Validate inputs
    route-handler            ;; Route to appropriate domain
    (conditional-handler     ;; Branch based on amount
      (< amount 1000) simple-transfer-handler
      (>= amount 1000) complex-transfer-handler)
    receipt-handler))        ;; Generate receipt

;; Handlers can orchestrate multi-step processes
(defhandler multi-domain-workflow : Request → FinalResult
  (fn [request]
    ;; Transform request into optimized effect sequence
    (let [domain-effects (partition-by-domain request.effects)]
      (optimize-cross-domain-execution domain-effects))))
```

### Intent-Based Workflow Specification

Instead of explicit workflow definitions, users specify desired outcomes:

```lisp
(intent
  :resources [source-account target-account]
  :constraint (and 
    (sufficient-balance source-account amount)
    (authorized-transfer source-account target-account))
  :effects [
    (Transfer :from source-account :to escrow :amount amount)
    (Validate :escrow escrow :rules compliance-rules)
    (Transfer :from escrow :to target-account :amount amount)]
  :hints (hint-all
    (minimize latency)
    (prefer-atomic-execution)))
```

The runtime synthesizes the optimal execution path, including:
- Parallel execution where possible
- Automatic batching of similar effects
- Cross-domain coordination
- Failure handling and rollback

### Dynamic Workflow Adaptation

The optimization system can dynamically adapt workflows based on:

1. **Runtime Conditions**: Available resources, domain load, network latency
2. **Effect Hints**: Batching preferences, deadline constraints, domain routing
3. **Handler Transformations**: Pure handlers can reorganize effect sequences
4. **TEG Analysis**: Critical path optimization, parallelization opportunities

### Cross-Domain Workflow Coordination

Cross-domain workflows leverage the TEG structure:

```lisp
;; Effects automatically routed to appropriate domains
(defeffect CrossChainTransfer [params]
  :pre (and (valid-source params.source) (valid-target params.target))
  :post (transferred params.amount params.source params.target)
  :hints (hint-all
    (require-domain params.source.domain)  ;; Source domain
    (require-domain params.target.domain)  ;; Target domain
    (prefer-atomic-execution)))
```

The optimizer handles:
- Domain capability matching
- Cross-domain resource transfers
- Consistency guarantees
- Optimal routing decisions

## Orchestration Hints and Preferences

The framework provides mechanisms for applications to influence optimization and orchestration decisions through the structured hint system defined at Layer 2. These hints guide execution without affecting correctness, maintaining the declarative nature of the system.

### Structured Hint Language

The formal hint language provides precise optimization guidance:

```lisp
h ::= BatchWith(selector)                  ;; Batch with effects matching selector
    | Minimize(metric)                     ;; Minimize price | latency
    | Maximize(metric)                     ;; Maximize price | latency
    | PreferDomain(domain)                 ;; Soft domain preference
    | RequireDomain(domain)                ;; Hard domain requirement
    | Deadline(timestamp)                  ;; Completion time preference
    | HintAll([h₁, ..., hₙ])              ;; Conjunction of hints
    | HintAny([h₁, ..., hₙ])              ;; Disjunction of hints

selector ::= SameType                      ;; Effects with same type tag
           | SameTarget                    ;; Effects with same target address  
           | Custom(predicate)             ;; User-defined selection predicate

metric ::= Price | Latency
```

### Workflow Orchestration Hints

Workflow orchestration hints extend the base hint system with workflow-specific guidance:

```rust
pub struct WorkflowOrchestrationHint {
    pub preferred_strategy_id: Str,
    pub priority: u32,
    pub workflow_type: WorkflowType,            // Type of workflow pattern
    pub resource_constraints: ResourceUsageEstimate,
    pub domain_preference_order: Vec<TypedDomain>,  // Maps to PreferDomain hints
    pub prefer_parallel_execution: bool,            // Influences batching
    pub max_latency_ms: Option<u64>,               // Maps to Deadline hint
    pub cost_budget: Option<u64>,                  // Constraint on optimization
}

pub enum WorkflowType {
    Sequential,      // Effects must execute in order
    Parallel,        // Effects can execute simultaneously  
    Conditional,     // Branching based on conditions
    Iterative,       // Repeat until condition met
    Composite,       // Combination of patterns
}
```

### Hint Interpretation

The optimization system interprets hints to guide execution decisions:

- **BatchWith(SameType)**: Groups effects with identical tags for batch execution
- **Minimize(Latency)**: Prioritizes fast execution paths, may allocate more resources
- **PreferDomain(domain)**: Influences domain selection when multiple options exist
- **Deadline(timestamp)**: Creates urgency-based scheduling priorities
- **HintAll/HintAny**: Combines multiple hints with AND/OR semantics

Strategy preferences enable applications to specify their preferred optimization approach while allowing the framework to override these preferences when necessary. The framework considers these preferences alongside system constraints and current resource availability.

Resource constraints provide hard limits on resource usage that the optimization system must respect. These constraints prevent resource exhaustion and ensure that Intent execution remains within acceptable bounds.

Domain preferences, expressed through `PreferDomain` and `RequireDomain` hints, specify the preferred order for domain selection when multiple domains could execute the same Intent. The framework considers these preferences alongside domain capabilities and current load when making execution decisions.

## Dynamic Optimization

The optimization system adapts to changing system conditions through dynamic optimization capabilities. These capabilities enable the framework to adjust optimization strategies based on current resource availability, system load, and performance metrics.

Performance monitoring provides real-time feedback about system performance and resource utilization. This information enables the optimization system to detect performance bottlenecks, resource constraints, and opportunities for improvement.

Adaptive strategy selection enables the framework to switch between optimization strategies based on current conditions. During periods of high load, the system might prioritize latency optimization, while during low-load periods it might focus on cost minimization.

Load balancing capabilities distribute Intent execution across available resources and domains to prevent bottlenecks and ensure optimal resource utilization. The load balancing system considers both current load and predicted future demand when making distribution decisions.

## Integration with Domain System

The optimization system integrates closely with the framework's domain system to make informed decisions about where and how to execute Intents. Different domains provide different capabilities and performance characteristics that influence optimization decisions.

Domain capability assessment evaluates the suitability of different domains for specific Intent types. This assessment considers computational capabilities, resource availability, security requirements, and integration capabilities when making domain selection decisions.

Cross-domain optimization enables the framework to orchestrate workflows that span multiple domains while maintaining optimal performance. The system considers the costs and benefits of cross-domain communication when designing execution strategies.

Domain-specific optimization strategies can be implemented to take advantage of unique domain capabilities or address domain-specific constraints. These strategies enable fine-tuned optimization for specialized execution environments.

## Temporal Effect Graph Integration

The optimization system leverages the **Temporal Effect Graph (TEG)** to visualize and optimize effect execution across time and domains. The TEG provides:

### Graph-Based Optimization

Each effect becomes a node in the temporal graph with:
- **Causal dependencies**: Resource flows between effects
- **Temporal constraints**: Deadlines and ordering requirements
- **Pre/post conditions**: Constraint verification points
- **Optimization hints**: Guide graph traversal and scheduling

```lisp
;; TEG node structure
(effect-node
  :id E1
  :effect (Transfer :from alice :to bob :amount 100)
  :pre (and (>= (balance alice) 100) (has-capability :transfer))
  :post (= (+ (balance alice) (balance bob)) (prev-total))
  :hints (hint-all (minimize latency) (batch-with same-type))
  :time T1
  :resources {:consumed [alice-token] :produced [alice-token' bob-token']})
```

### Optimization Opportunities

The TEG enables several optimization strategies:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Independent branches can execute simultaneously
2. **Effect Batching**: Effects with `BatchWith` hints are grouped
3. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify and optimize bottlenecks
4. **Resource Flow Optimization**: Minimize resource movement between domains
5. **Temporal Scheduling**: Meet deadlines while minimizing resource usage

### Causality Preservation

The linear type system ensures causality is preserved:
- Resources consumed exactly once establish temporal ordering
- Causal chains tracked through resource dependencies
- No temporal paradoxes possible due to linearity

### Privacy-Preserving Optimization

The TEG supports optimization without revealing sensitive details:
- Effect nodes can use commitments instead of plain values
- Causal relationships proven in zero-knowledge
- Optimization decisions based on public metadata and hints

This integration enables the optimizer to make globally optimal decisions while respecting local constraints and privacy requirements.
