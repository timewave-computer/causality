# Troubleshooting and Debugging

The Causality framework provides various tools and techniques for diagnosing and resolving issues that may arise during development and testing. This guidance focuses on the practical troubleshooting approaches that are most effective given the current state of the framework implementation, emphasizing build system issues, testing problems, and development environment concerns.

The troubleshooting approach emphasizes systematic diagnosis of issues through careful examination of error messages, verification of environment setup, and methodical testing of individual components. This systematic approach helps isolate problems and identify the most effective solutions while avoiding the common pitfall of attempting complex fixes before understanding the root cause.

## Build System Troubleshooting

Build and compilation issues represent the most common category of problems encountered during Causality framework development. These issues typically stem from dependency management problems, environment configuration issues, or workspace structure complications that prevent proper compilation of the various framework components.

Rust compilation errors often manifest as missing dependencies, undeclared crate references, or feature compilation failures. These problems usually indicate issues with the development environment setup or workspace configuration rather than fundamental code problems. The Cargo build system provides detailed error messages that can guide diagnosis and resolution.

```bash
# Check if all dependencies are available
cargo check

# Verify workspace structure
cargo metadata --format-version 1 | jq '.workspace_members'

# Check specific crate dependencies
cargo tree -p causality-types
```

Dependency resolution problems frequently occur when the Nix development environment is not properly activated or when workspace dependencies become inconsistent. The framework relies on specific versions of dependencies that are managed through the Nix flake configuration, and deviation from this environment can cause compilation failures.

Type system errors and trait implementation issues typically indicate missing imports, incorrect feature flag configuration, or version mismatches between framework components. The Rust type system provides detailed error messages that can guide resolution, but these errors often require careful attention to the specific trait bounds and type requirements of the framework.

OCaml build issues in the ml_causality project usually stem from missing dependencies, incorrect OCaml version configuration, or dune build system problems. The OCaml ecosystem has its own dependency management requirements that must be satisfied independently of the Rust components, though the Nix environment provides most necessary tools.

## Testing and Validation Issues

Testing problems in the Causality framework typically fall into categories of unit test failures, integration test issues, and test environment configuration problems. The framework includes comprehensive testing infrastructure, but proper test execution requires careful attention to feature flags, test data setup, and environment configuration.

Unit test failures often indicate problems with test data generation, missing test utilities, or incorrect feature flag configuration. The framework's testing infrastructure relies on specific features that must be enabled during test execution, particularly for the causality-toolkit crate which includes extensive testing utilities.

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_resource_creation -- --nocapture

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p causality-types

# Run tests with features
cargo test -p causality-toolkit --features testing
```

Integration testing issues frequently arise from cross-crate dependency problems or missing test utilities. The framework includes several test scripts that coordinate testing across multiple components, and these scripts require proper permissions and environment setup to execute correctly.

Test script execution problems often stem from permission issues, missing dependencies, or incorrect working directory assumptions. The framework includes shell scripts for comprehensive testing that must be executed with appropriate permissions and from the correct directory context.

Feature-dependent test failures typically indicate that required features are not enabled during test execution. The framework uses feature flags to control the availability of testing utilities and other optional functionality, and test execution must include the appropriate feature specifications.

## Serialization and Data Integrity

Serialization issues in the Causality framework typically involve SSZ encoding and decoding problems that can manifest as data corruption, length mismatches, or deserialization failures. The framework relies on deterministic serialization for content addressing and data integrity, making proper serialization crucial for correct operation.

SSZ serialization problems often stem from schema inconsistencies, field order mismatches, or data validation failures. The Simple Serialize format requires careful attention to data structure layout and type consistency to ensure reliable encoding and decoding operations.

```rust
use causality_types::serialization::*;

// Test serialization roundtrip
let resource = Resource::default();
let serialized = resource.as_ssz_bytes();
println!("Serialized length: {}", serialized.len());

match Resource::from_ssz_bytes(&serialized) {
    Ok(deserialized) => {
        if resource == deserialized {
            println!("Serialization OK");
        } else {
            println!("Data mismatch after roundtrip");
        }
    }
    Err(e) => println!("Deserialization failed: {:?}", e),
}
```

Content addressing issues can arise when serialization produces inconsistent results or when hash computation encounters unexpected data formats. The framework's content addressing system depends on deterministic serialization to ensure that identical content produces identical identifiers.

Data validation problems often indicate that data structures contain invalid values or violate framework constraints before serialization attempts. The framework includes validation logic that should catch these issues, but complex data structures may require additional validation steps.

Version compatibility issues can occur when different framework components use incompatible serialization schemas or when data persisted with older versions cannot be properly deserialized with newer code. The framework's serialization system is designed to be stable, but development changes may occasionally introduce compatibility issues.

## Expression System Debugging

The Lisp interpreter and expression system can encounter various issues related to expression evaluation, type checking, and context management. These problems often manifest as evaluation failures, type errors, or context-related exceptions during expression processing.

Expression evaluation errors typically stem from malformed expressions, missing context values, or type mismatches during evaluation. The interpreter provides detailed error information that can guide diagnosis, but complex expressions may require systematic debugging to identify the specific problem.

```rust
use causality_lisp::*;

// Test basic interpreter functionality
let interpreter = Interpreter::new();
let context = DefaultExprContext::new();

// Test simple expression
let expr = Expr::Const(ValueExpr::Int(42));
match interpreter.eval(&expr, &context) {
    Ok(result) => println!("Result: {:?}", result),
    Err(e) => println!("Evaluation error: {:?}", e),
}
```

Context management issues can arise when expressions reference variables or functions that are not available in the evaluation context. The expression system requires proper context setup to provide access to the variables and functions needed for expression evaluation.

Type system problems in the expression evaluator often indicate mismatches between expected and actual value types during evaluation. The expression system includes type checking logic, but complex expressions may encounter type errors that require careful analysis to resolve.

Combinator evaluation issues can occur when combinator expressions are malformed or when the combinator system encounters unexpected argument patterns. The combinator system provides powerful composition capabilities, but proper usage requires understanding of the mathematical properties of the various combinators.

## Development Environment Issues

Development environment problems often stem from Nix configuration issues, missing tools, or incorrect environment activation. The framework relies on a comprehensive Nix-based development environment that provides all necessary tools and dependencies for productive development.

Nix environment activation problems can prevent access to the tools and dependencies needed for framework development. The development environment must be properly activated through nix develop or direnv to ensure that all necessary tools are available.

Tool version mismatches can occur when the development environment provides different versions of tools than expected by the framework build system. The Nix configuration specifies exact tool versions to ensure consistency, but environment problems can sometimes cause version conflicts.

Path and library configuration issues can prevent proper compilation or execution of framework components. The Nix environment configures paths and library locations automatically, but manual environment modifications can sometimes interfere with proper configuration.

Permission and access issues can prevent execution of test scripts or access to necessary files during development. The framework includes various scripts and tools that require appropriate permissions to execute correctly.

## Performance and Resource Issues

Performance problems during development typically manifest as slow build times, excessive memory usage, or long test execution times. These issues can significantly impact development productivity and may indicate underlying problems with the development environment or framework configuration.

Build performance issues often stem from inefficient dependency resolution, missing build caches, or suboptimal compilation settings. The Cargo build system includes various optimization features that can improve build performance when properly configured.

Memory usage problems during testing or development can indicate resource leaks, inefficient data structures, or excessive test data generation. The framework includes monitoring capabilities that can help identify resource usage patterns and potential optimization opportunities.

Test execution performance issues can arise from inefficient test data generation, excessive test coverage, or suboptimal test organization. The testing infrastructure includes various optimization features that can improve test execution speed when properly utilized.

## Current Debugging Capabilities

The current framework implementation provides basic debugging and troubleshooting capabilities that support the essential development and testing workflows. These capabilities include comprehensive error reporting, detailed logging options, and systematic testing infrastructure that enables effective problem diagnosis.

Error reporting throughout the framework provides detailed information about failures while maintaining appropriate abstraction levels for different types of users. The error system includes both technical details for developers and higher-level descriptions for application users.

Logging and diagnostic capabilities enable detailed analysis of framework behavior during development and testing. The logging system provides configurable output levels and detailed information about internal framework operations.

Testing infrastructure enables systematic validation of framework functionality while providing detailed feedback about test results and any issues that arise. The testing system includes both automated testing capabilities and manual testing tools that support comprehensive validation.

Future development will focus on enhanced debugging capabilities, improved error reporting, and additional diagnostic tools that support more sophisticated troubleshooting scenarios. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for effective development and testing while identifying areas for future enhancement.
