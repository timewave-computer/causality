# Performance Benchmarks

This document provides information about running and interpreting performance benchmarks for the Causality framework, with a focus on the Resource Management System.

## Resource Management Benchmarks

The resource management system includes comprehensive benchmarks to measure performance across various components. These benchmarks are important for:

1. Establishing performance baselines
2. Detecting performance regressions
3. Identifying optimization opportunities
4. Validating performance improvements

### Running the Benchmarks

There are two ways to run the resource management benchmarks:

#### 1. Using the Benchmark Script

The simplest approach is to use the provided benchmark script:

```bash
./scripts/run_resource_benchmarks.sh
```

This script will:
- Run all resource management benchmarks
- Generate a performance report in the `benchmark_results` directory
- Create a summary of the benchmark results
- Compare with previous benchmark runs (if available)

#### 2. Running Benchmarks Manually

You can also run the benchmarks manually using Cargo:

```bash
# Using Rust's built-in benchmark framework
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg feature=\"unstable-bench\"" cargo +nightly bench --bench resource_benchmarks

# If using Criterion (requires criterion dependencies)
cargo bench --bench resource_benchmarks
```

### Benchmark Categories

The resource management benchmarks cover the following categories:

1. **Resource Lifecycle Operations** - Measures the performance of resource creation, state updates, and destruction
2. **Resource Access Control** - Evaluates the overhead of access checking and recording
3. **Resource Locking** - Tests the performance of lock acquisition, validation, and release
4. **Resource Dependencies** - Benchmarks dependency creation, validation, and management
5. **Implementation Overhead** - Compares the overhead of trait-based interfaces vs. direct function calls

### Interpreting Benchmark Results

The benchmark results are reported in nanoseconds per iteration (ns/iter). Lower values indicate better performance. When analyzing the results, consider:

- **Baseline Comparison** - Compare against established baselines to detect regressions
- **Relative Performance** - Compare the relative cost of different operations
- **Optimization Opportunities** - Identify operations with unexpectedly high costs
- **Implementation Overhead** - Evaluate the cost of abstractions vs. direct calls

### Adding New Benchmarks

To add new benchmarks for resource management:

1. Edit `crates/causality-effects/benches/resource_benchmarks.rs`
2. Add new benchmark functions with the `#[bench]` attribute
3. Ensure benchmarks are isolated and measure specific functionality
4. Focus on realistic usage patterns and edge cases

## Other Performance Considerations

When working with the resource management system, consider these performance guidelines:

1. **Batch Operations** - Group related operations when possible to reduce overhead
2. **Context Reuse** - Reuse resource contexts when performing multiple operations
3. **Lock Granularity** - Use the most specific lock type needed for your operation
4. **Dependency Management** - Be mindful of dependency chains that could impact performance
5. **Asynchronous Operations** - Consider the overhead of asynchronous runtime for short-lived operations

## Performance Optimization Workflow

Follow this workflow when optimizing performance:

1. Run benchmarks to establish a baseline
2. Identify the slowest operations
3. Profile the code to find bottlenecks
4. Make targeted optimizations
5. Run benchmarks again to validate improvements
6. Document performance characteristics and trade-offs

By following these practices, we can ensure the resource management system maintains excellent performance while providing its comprehensive feature set.
