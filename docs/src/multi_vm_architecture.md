# Multi-VM Architecture and Cross-Chain Operations

This document outlines the architecture for working with multiple blockchain virtual machines (VMs) and implementing cross-chain operations in the TimeWave Causality system.

## Overview

The system provides a unified framework for interacting with different blockchain VMs, including:

- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- CosmWasm VM
- Succinct VM
- Custom VMs

The architecture is designed to facilitate cross-chain operations, validation of effects across domains, and coordination of complex multi-step operations that span multiple blockchains.

## Core Components

### 1. VM Adapters

VM adapters provide an abstraction layer for interacting with specific blockchain VMs:

- `VmAdapter`: Base trait for all VM adapters
- `CompilationAdapter`: For VMs that support program compilation
- `ZkProofAdapter`: For VMs that support zero-knowledge proofs
- `CrossVmAdapter`: For VMs that support cross-VM operations

Each adapter implementation handles the specifics of communicating with its respective blockchain, managing state, and translating operations to VM-specific formats.

### 2. Validation System

The validation system ensures that effects are valid before they are executed:

- `ValidationContext`: Contains information about the effect being validated
- `ValidationRule`: Defines rules for validating effects
- `ValidationResult`: Represents the outcome of validation
- `EffectValidator`: Trait for implementing custom validators

Validators perform checks such as parameter validation, format verification, and domain-specific business rules.

### 3. Coordination System

The coordination system manages complex operations that span multiple VMs:

- `CoordinationContext`: Maintains the context of a coordination operation
- `CoordinationStep`: Defines individual steps in the coordination process
- `CoordinationPlan`: Encapsulates the overall coordination context and steps
- `CoordinationExecutor`: Executes coordination plans with dependency management

This system supports complex workflows like cross-chain asset transfers, multi-stage contract deployments, and coordinated state updates across domains.

### 4. Cross-VM Broker

The `CrossVmBroker` facilitates communication between different VM adapters:

- Manages registered adapters by domain
- Routes requests to appropriate adapters
- Manages cross-VM handlers for specific operations
- Provides utilities for translating data between VM formats

## Implementation Guide

### Creating a New VM Adapter

1. Implement the `VmAdapter` trait for your blockchain VM
2. Optionally implement additional traits like `CompilationAdapter` or `ZkProofAdapter`
3. Create a factory that can instantiate your adapter from configuration
4. Register your adapter with the `DomainAdapterRegistry`

Example:

```rust
impl VmAdapter for MyCustomAdapter {
    fn vm_type(&self) -> VmType {
        VmType::Custom("my-vm".to_string())
    }
    
    fn domain_id(&self) -> &DomainId {
        &self.config.domain_id
    }
    
    // Implement other required methods...
}
```

### Validating Effects

1. Create a validator that implements the `EffectValidator` trait
2. Define validation rules for your domain-specific effects
3. Register the validator with the `EffectValidatorRegistry`

Example:

```rust
impl EffectValidator for MyEffectValidator {
    fn validate(&self, context: &ValidationContext) -> Result<ValidationResult> {
        let mut result = ValidationResult::valid();
        
        // Check required parameters
        if !context.params.contains_key("required_param") {
            result.add_error(ValidationError::error(
                "required_param", 
                "This parameter is required", 
                "E001"
            ));
        }
        
        // Additional validation...
        
        Ok(result)
    }
    
    // Implement other required methods...
}
```

### Creating a Coordination Plan

1. Create a `CoordinationContext` to define the scope of the operation
2. Define `CoordinationStep` instances for each step in the process
3. Add dependencies between steps to establish execution order
4. Execute the plan using a `CoordinationExecutor`

Example:

```rust
// Create a coordination plan
let mut plan = CoordinationPlan::new(
    CoordinationContext::new("cross_chain_transfer")
        .add_domain(ethereum_domain.clone())
        .add_domain(cosmos_domain.clone())
);

// Add steps with dependencies
plan.add_step(CoordinationStep::new(
    "deploy_evm_contract",
    ethereum_domain.clone(),
    "deploy_contract",
    params,
));

plan.add_step(CoordinationStep::new(
    "execute_function",
    ethereum_domain.clone(),
    "execute_function",
    params,
).add_dependency("deploy_evm_contract"));

// Execute the plan
let executor = CoordinationExecutor::new(broker, validator_registry);
let result = executor.execute_plan(plan)?;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Domain Isolation**: Keep domain-specific logic within the respective adapter implementations
2. **Explicit Validation**: Always validate effects before execution
3. **Dependency Management**: Clearly define dependencies between coordination steps
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for cross-chain operations
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Design operations to be safely retryable
6. **State Verification**: Verify state across chains before and after operations
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to handle partial failures in cross-chain operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Cross-Chain Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across chains
2. **Reorgs and Finality**: Handle varying finality guarantees between chains
3. **Atomic Operations**: Ensure operations are atomic or can be safely rolled back
4. **Network Partitions**: Handle network partitions between different blockchains
5. **Authentication**: Securely manage keys and authentication across domains
6. **Replay Protection**: Implement nonce-based replay protection for cross-chain messages

## Examples

See the `scripts/multi_vm_demo.rs` for a complete example of a cross-chain operation using the coordination system.

## Future Directions

1. **Dynamic Discovery**: Implement dynamic discovery of VM adapters
2. **Optimistic Execution**: Support optimistic execution with rollback capability
3. **State Synchronization**: Implement efficient state synchronization protocols
4. **Automated Verification**: Develop automated verification of cross-VM operations
5. **Event-Based Coordination**: Support event-based triggers for coordination steps
