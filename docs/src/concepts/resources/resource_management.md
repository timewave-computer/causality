# Resource Management System

The Resource Management System provides a comprehensive framework for managing resources across domain and effect boundaries in the Causality framework. It consists of several key components that work together to ensure proper access control, lifecycle management, resource locking, and dependency tracking.

## Components

### Resource Access Control

The access control component manages how resources are accessed within the system:

- **ResourceAccessType**: Defines different types of access (Read, Write, Execute, Lock, Transfer)
- **ResourceAccess**: Records details about resource access operations
- **ResourceAccessTracker**: Tracks all accesses to resources
- **ResourceAccessManager**: Coordinates access across effects and domains

```rust
// Example of recording resource access
access_manager.record_access(
    &resource_id,
    ResourceAccessType::Read,
    Some(&effect_id),
    Some(&domain_id)
);
```

### Resource Lifecycle Management

The lifecycle component manages the state transitions of resources:

- **ResourceLifecycleEvent**: Defines different lifecycle events (Created, Activated, Locked, etc.)
- **LifecycleEvent**: Records details about lifecycle events
- **EffectResourceLifecycle**: Manages the lifecycle of resources
- **ResourceLifecycleEffect**: Creates effects for resource lifecycle operations

```rust
// Example of activating a resource
lifecycle_manager.activate_resource(&resource_id, Some(&effect_id), Some(&domain_id));
```

### Cross-Domain Resource Locking

The locking component provides mechanisms for securing resources across domain boundaries:

- **CrossDomainLockType**: Defines different types of locks (Exclusive, Shared, Intent)
- **ResourceLock**: Represents a lock on a resource
- **CrossDomainLockManager**: Manages resource locks
- **AcquireLockEffect/ReleaseLockEffect**: Effect wrappers for locking operations

```rust
// Example of acquiring a lock
let lock_result = lock_manager.acquire_lock(
    &resource_id,
    CrossDomainLockType::Exclusive,
    &domain_id,
    &effect_id,
    None,
    None
);
```

### Resource Dependency Tracking

The dependency component tracks relationships between resources:

- **DependencyType**: Defines different types of dependencies (Strong, Weak, Temporal, etc.)
- **ResourceDependency**: Represents a dependency between resources
- **ResourceDependencyManager**: Manages resource dependencies

```rust
// Example of adding a dependency
dependency_manager.add_dependency(
    &source_id,
    &target_id,
    DependencyType::Strong,
    Some(&domain_id),
    Some(&effect_id),
    None
);
```

### Resource Capabilities

The capability component integrates the resource management system with the unified capability system:

- **ResourceCapability**: Defines resource-specific capabilities
- **ResourceLifecycleCapability**: Defines lifecycle-specific capabilities
- **ResourceCapabilityManager**: Manages resource capabilities

```rust
// Example of checking a capability
let has_capability = capability_manager.check_access_capability(
    &resource_id,
    ResourceAccessType::Read,
    Some(&effect_id),
    Some(&domain_id),
    &context
).await?;
```

### Cross-Domain Resource Effects

The cross-domain effects component provides pre-built effects for common cross-domain resource operations:

- **CrossDomainResourceTransferEffect**: Transfers resources between domains
- **CrossDomainResourceLockEffect**: Locks resources across multiple domains
- **CrossDomainResourceDependencyEffect**: Establishes dependencies between resources in different domains

```rust
// Example of creating a resource transfer effect
let transfer_effect = transfer_resource(
    resource_id,
    source_domain_id,
    target_domain_id,
    resource_managers
);

// Execute the transfer
let outcome = transfer_effect.execute(&context).await?;
```

## Cross-Domain Resource Management

When working with resources that span multiple domains, special considerations are needed:

### Resource Transfer Process

Transferring a resource across domains involves these steps:

1. Lock the resource in the source domain
2. Register the resource in the target domain
3. Create appropriate dependencies between domains
4. Update resource lifecycle states in both domains
5. Transfer ownership and capabilities
6. Release locks when the transfer is complete

### Distributed Locking

The CrossDomainLockManager provides distributed locking capabilities:

- Acquires locks across multiple domains
- Ensures all-or-nothing semantics (either all locks are acquired or none)
- Supports different lock types (Exclusive, Shared, Intent)
- Handles timeouts and deadlock prevention

### Cross-Domain Dependencies

Resources can have dependencies that span domain boundaries:

- **Data Dependencies**: Resources that rely on data from other domains
- **Temporal Dependencies**: Resources with timing dependencies across domains
- **Identity Dependencies**: Resources that share identity across domains
- **Strong vs Weak Dependencies**: Different levels of dependency enforcement

## Integration with Other Systems

The Resource Management System integrates with other parts of the Causality framework:

- **Domain System**: Resources can be domain-specific and accessed across domains
- **Effect System**: Effects can operate on resources and require appropriate capabilities
- **Capability System**: The unified capability system governs access to resources

## Best Practices

1. **Explicit Access Control**: Always use the access control system to record resource access
2. **Proper Lifecycle Management**: Track resource lifecycle events for auditing and state management
3. **Cross-Domain Coordination**: Use locking mechanisms when resources are accessed across domains
4. **Dependency Management**: Track resource dependencies to maintain consistency
5. **Capability-Based Authorization**: Use the capability system to authorize resource operations
6. **Use Cross-Domain Effects**: Leverage pre-built cross-domain effects for common operations
7. **Transaction Boundaries**: Define clear transaction boundaries for cross-domain operations

By following these practices, the Resource Management System helps maintain the integrity, security, and consistency of resources throughout the Causality framework.
