# API Reference and Examples

The Causality framework provides a comprehensive API for working with resource-based applications through a collection of core types and utilities. This reference documentation covers the actual implemented functionality and demonstrates practical usage patterns for building applications on the framework.

The API design emphasizes type safety, deterministic behavior, and content addressing while providing natural interfaces for common resource management operations. All types implement the necessary traits for serialization, content addressing, and integration with the broader framework infrastructure.

## Resource Management API

The Resource type serves as the fundamental building block for representing quantifiable assets or capabilities within the Causality framework. This type captures the essential properties needed for resource tracking while supporting the content addressing and serialization requirements of the framework.

Resource creation involves specifying an identifier, human-readable name, domain association, type classification, quantity information, and temporal metadata. The Resource structure provides all necessary information for resource tracking while maintaining the immutability and determinism required for reliable resource management.

```rust
pub struct Resource {
    /// Unique identifier for this resource
    pub id: EntityId,
    /// Human-readable name or description
    pub name: Str,
    /// Domain this resource belongs to
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
    /// Resource type identifier (e.g., "token", "compute_credits")
    pub resource_type: Str,
    /// Current quantity/amount of this resource
    pub quantity: u64,
    /// When this resource was created or last updated
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```

Resource instantiation can be accomplished through direct construction with all required fields or through builder patterns that provide convenient defaults for common use cases. The Resource type supports both programmatic creation for automated systems and manual creation for testing and development scenarios.

Resource operations include property access, pattern matching, and validation against various constraints. The Resource API provides methods for extracting specific properties while maintaining type safety and enabling efficient processing of resource collections.

Pattern matching capabilities enable sophisticated resource selection and filtering based on type, domain, quantity ranges, and custom constraints. These patterns support both exact matching for specific resource requirements and flexible matching for resource discovery and allocation scenarios.

## Resource Flow Modeling

ResourceFlow represents the movement of resources between different components or operations within the framework. This type captures the essential information needed for resource tracking while supporting the composition and validation of complex resource transformation workflows.

ResourceFlow creation requires specification of the resource type, quantity, and domain context. This information enables the framework to understand resource dependencies and validate that resource transformations maintain conservation properties and respect domain boundaries.

```rust
pub struct ResourceFlow {
    pub resource_type: Str,
    pub quantity: u64,
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
}
```

Flow composition enables the construction of complex resource transformation patterns from simple flow primitives. The ResourceFlow API supports both individual flow creation and bulk flow operations that handle collections of related resource movements.

Flow validation ensures that resource transformations respect conservation laws and domain constraints while maintaining the deterministic properties required for reliable execution. The validation system can detect potential issues such as resource shortfalls or domain boundary violations before execution begins.

## Intent Processing Interface

The Intent type represents requests for resource transformations that specify desired inputs, outputs, and processing requirements. Intents serve as the primary interface for requesting resource operations while providing the information needed for optimization and execution planning.

Intent construction involves specifying identification information, processing requirements, resource flows, and optional optimization hints. The Intent structure captures both the essential transformation requirements and additional metadata that enables sophisticated optimization and routing decisions.

```rust
pub struct Intent {
    pub id: EntityId,
    pub name: Str,
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
    pub priority: u32,
    pub inputs: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub outputs: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub expression: Option<ExprId>,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    // Additional fields for optimization hints
    pub optimization_hint: Option<ExprId>,
    pub target_typed_domain: Option<TypedDomain>,
    pub process_dataflow_hint: Option<ProcessDataflowInitiationHint>,
}
```

Intent processing involves validation of resource requirements, optimization of execution strategies, and routing to appropriate execution domains. The Intent API provides methods for extracting processing requirements while enabling the framework to make intelligent decisions about execution optimization.

Priority handling enables sophisticated scheduling of Intent processing based on business requirements and resource availability. The priority system supports both simple numeric priorities and complex priority functions that consider multiple factors in scheduling decisions.

Optimization hints provide applications with the ability to influence execution strategies while maintaining the framework's ability to make optimal decisions based on current system state and resource availability. These hints enable performance optimization without compromising the deterministic properties of the framework.

## Effect Execution System

The Effect type represents the actual execution of resource transformations, capturing both the transformation logic and the resource flows involved in the operation. Effects provide the detailed information needed for execution while supporting verification and auditing of completed operations.

Effect creation involves specifying the transformation logic, resource flows, execution context, and metadata needed for proper execution and verification. The Effect structure captures both the immediate transformation requirements and the broader context needed for integration with the framework's execution infrastructure.

```rust
pub struct Effect {
    pub id: EntityId,
    pub name: Str,
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
    pub effect_type: Str,
    pub inputs: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub outputs: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub expression: Option<ExprId>,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    pub resources: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub nullifiers: Vec<ResourceFlow>,
    pub scoped_by: HandlerId,
    pub intent_id: Option<ExprId>,
    pub source_typed_domain: TypedDomain,
    pub target_typed_domain: TypedDomain,
    // Additional metadata fields
    pub cost_model: Option<EffectCostModel>,
    pub resource_usage_estimate: Option<ResourceUsageEstimate>,
    pub originating_dataflow_instance: Option<ProcessDataflowInstanceId>,
}
```

Effect execution involves processing the transformation logic while maintaining proper resource accounting and domain isolation. The Effect API provides methods for extracting execution requirements while enabling the framework to ensure proper resource conservation and constraint satisfaction.

Nullifier generation enables proper tracking of consumed resources while preventing double-spending and other resource management errors. The nullifier system provides cryptographic proof of resource consumption while maintaining the privacy properties needed for sophisticated applications.

Cost modeling enables sophisticated resource allocation and optimization decisions based on the computational and resource costs of different operations. The cost model system supports both simple cost estimates and complex cost functions that consider multiple factors in optimization decisions.

## Handler Management Interface

The Handler type represents the processing logic responsible for executing specific types of Effects within particular domains. Handlers provide the interface between the framework's execution engine and application-specific transformation logic.

Handler registration involves specifying the types of Effects that the Handler can process, the execution domain, and the priority for Handler selection. The Handler structure enables the framework to route Effects to appropriate processing logic while maintaining proper isolation and execution guarantees.

```rust
pub struct Handler {
    pub id: HandlerId,
    pub name: Str,
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
    pub handler_type: Str,
    pub priority: u32,
    pub expression: Option<ExprId>,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```

Handler selection involves matching Effect requirements with available Handler capabilities while considering priority, domain constraints, and resource availability. The Handler API enables sophisticated routing decisions that optimize execution efficiency while maintaining correctness guarantees.

Handler composition enables the construction of complex processing pipelines from simple Handler primitives. The composition system supports both sequential processing patterns and more complex patterns that involve parallel execution and conditional routing.

## Transaction Coordination

The Transaction type provides coordination of multiple Effects that must be executed atomically to maintain system consistency. Transactions enable complex resource transformations that involve multiple steps while ensuring that partial execution cannot leave the system in an inconsistent state.

Transaction construction involves specifying the collection of Effects that must be executed together along with the coordination requirements and rollback procedures needed for proper atomicity. The Transaction structure captures both the immediate execution requirements and the broader coordination context.

```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    pub id: EntityId,
    pub name: Str,
    pub domain_id: DomainId,
    pub effects: Vec<EntityId>,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```

Transaction execution involves coordinating the execution of multiple Effects while maintaining proper resource accounting and ensuring that either all Effects complete successfully or none of them have any lasting impact on system state. The Transaction API provides methods for managing this coordination while enabling efficient execution.

Transaction validation ensures that the collection of Effects within a Transaction maintains resource conservation properties and respects all domain and constraint requirements. The validation system can detect potential issues before execution begins, preventing partial execution that could compromise system consistency.

## Expression System Integration

The framework includes a comprehensive expression system that enables sophisticated transformation logic while maintaining the deterministic properties required for reliable execution. The expression system supports both simple value operations and complex functional programming patterns.

Expression construction involves building abstract syntax trees that represent transformation logic using the framework's expression types. The expression system provides both low-level primitives for maximum flexibility and high-level abstractions for common patterns.

```rust
pub enum Expr {
    Atom(Atom),
    Const(ValueExpr),
    Var(Str),
    Lambda(Vec<Str>, Box<Expr>),
    Apply(Box<Expr>, Vec<Expr>),
    Combinator(AtomicCombinator),
    Dynamic(u32, Box<Expr>),
}
```

Expression evaluation provides deterministic execution of transformation logic while maintaining proper isolation and resource accounting. The evaluation system supports both immediate evaluation for simple operations and lazy evaluation for complex computations that may not be needed immediately.

Expression composition enables the construction of complex transformation logic from simple expression primitives. The composition system supports functional programming patterns while maintaining the mathematical properties needed for verification and optimization.

## Serialization and Content Addressing

All framework types implement SSZ serialization that enables deterministic encoding and content addressing. The serialization system provides both compact representations for efficient storage and transmission and expanded formats for debugging and development.

Content addressing provides deterministic identification of all framework entities based on their content rather than arbitrary identifiers. This approach enables powerful deduplication, verification, and caching capabilities while ensuring that identical content receives identical identifiers regardless of when or where it is created.

Serialization utilities provide convenient interfaces for converting between different data representations while maintaining compatibility with the framework's content addressing requirements. These utilities handle the complexity of serialization while providing natural interfaces for application developers.

## Current Implementation Status

The current API provides comprehensive coverage of the core framework functionality with implementations that support the essential operations needed for resource-based applications. All core types include proper serialization, content addressing, and integration with the framework infrastructure.

The API design emphasizes type safety and deterministic behavior while providing natural interfaces for common operations. The implementation includes comprehensive testing and validation to ensure reliability and correctness across different usage patterns.

Future development will focus on additional convenience methods, performance optimizations, and enhanced integration capabilities while maintaining the stability and reliability of the core API. The current implementation provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated resource management applications.
