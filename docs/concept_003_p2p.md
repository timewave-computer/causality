## Key Features

### Rendezvous Hashing for Peer Discovery
Instead of using a DHT (Distributed Hash Table), this implementation uses rendezvous hashing for deterministic peer discovery. This approach has several advantages:
- Simpler implementation with fewer moving parts
- Deterministic node selection for resource location
- More consistent behavior in network partitions
- Efficient redistribution when peers join or leave

### Content-Addressed Logging
The logging system uses content addressing for log entries, which provides:
- Tamper-evident logs through cryptographic hashing
- Consistent references to log entries
- Ability to verify log integrity

### Protocol Versioning and Feature Flags
The protocol versioning system ensures:
- Smooth upgrades with backward compatibility
- Graceful handling of different feature sets
- Fine-grained capability negotiation

### ZK Proof Sharing (ADR_022)
The ZK proof sharing protocol enables secure and efficient distribution of zero-knowledge proofs:
- Bandwidth-efficient proof sharing with compression
- Verification key discovery and distribution
- Proof batch aggregation and partitioning
- Verifiable proof references through content-addressing

### Register State Synchronization (ADR_022)
The register state synchronization protocol provides:
- Efficient delta-based updates for register state
- State commitment verification
- Lazy loading of full state
- Prioritized synchronization for critical registers

### Execution Sequence Coordination (ADR_022)
The execution sequence coordination protocol enables collaborative execution:
- Distributed execution of complex sequence graphs
- Leader election for sequence orchestration
- Work distribution and load balancing
- Failure recovery and sequence retry logic

## P2P Communication Topics

The topic-based messaging system includes the following key topics for register-related communication:

2. **Announcement**: Node announces the proof availability on `register/proof/{verification_key_id}`
3. **Request**: Interested nodes request the proof by ID
4. **Delivery**: Node delivers the proof to requesting nodes
5. **Verification**: Receiving nodes verify the proof against the verification key
6. **Acknowledgment**: Successful verification is acknowledged

### Register State Synchronization Flow
1. **State Update**: Node processes a register state update
2. **Announcement**: Node announces the update on `register/update/{register_id}` with state hash
3. **Delta Request**: Nodes with previous state request deltas
4. **Full Request**: Nodes without previous state request full state
5. **Verification**: Receiving nodes verify state hash
6. **Application**: Nodes apply updates to their local state

### Execution Coordination Flow
1. **Sequence Creation**: Node creates an execution sequence
2. **Announcement**: Node announces the sequence on `execution/sequence/{sequence_id}`
3. **Node Claiming**: Nodes claim specific execution nodes
4. **Execution**: Nodes execute their claimed nodes
5. **Result Sharing**: Results are shared on `execution/node/{node_id}`
6. **Verification**: Sequence creator verifies results
7. **Completion**: Sequence completion announced on `execution/result/{sequence_id}`

## Integration with Register System

The P2P layer integrates with the register system (ADR_022) through several key interfaces:

### ProofSharingService

```rust
type ProofID = String;
type VerificationKeyID = String;
type Subscription = (); // Placeholder, replace with an actual type


#[async_trait]
pub trait ProofSharingService {
    async fn announce_proof(
        &self,
        proof_id: ProofID,
        verification_key_id: VerificationKeyID,
        public_inputs: Vec<Bytes>,
    );

    async fn request_proof(&self, proof_id: ProofID) -> Option<ProofMessage>;

    async fn subscribe_to_proofs<F>(&self, verification_key_id: VerificationKeyID, callback: F) -> Subscription
    where
        F: Fn(ProofMessage) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send + 'static;

    async fn verify_shared_proof(&self, proof_message: ProofMessage) -> bool;
}
```

### RegisterSyncService

```rust
### RegisterSyncService
type RegisterID = String;
type SyncError = String;
type Subscription = (); // Replace with an actual subscription type
type RegisterContents = Bytes;
type RegisterStateMessage = (); // Define properly

#[async_trait]
pub trait RegisterSyncService {
    /// Announce a register update with a new state hash.
    async fn announce_register_update(&self, register_id: RegisterID, state_hash: Bytes);

    /// Synchronize register state, returning either an error or the full register contents.
    async fn synchronize_register(&self, register_id: RegisterID) -> Result<RegisterContents, SyncError>;

    /// Subscribe to register updates, providing a callback function for handling updates.
    async fn subscribe_to_registers<F>(&self, register_id: RegisterID, callback: F) -> Subscription
    where
        F: Fn(RegisterStateMessage) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send + 'static;

    /// Verify register state against a given hash.
    async fn verify_register_state(&self, register_id: RegisterID, state_hash: Bytes) -> bool;
}
```

### ExecutionCoordinatorService
```rust
type SequenceID = String;
type NodeID = String;
type NodeClaimToken = String;
type ExecutionSequence = (); // Define properly
type ExecutionSequenceMessage = (); // Define properly
type ExecutionStatus = (); // Define properly
type ClaimError = String;
type SubmissionError = String;
type Subscription = (); // Replace with actual subscription type
type NodeResult = (); // Define as needed

#[async_trait]
pub trait ExecutionCoordinatorService {
    /// Announces a new execution sequence.
    async fn announce_sequence(&self, sequence_id: SequenceID, execution_sequence: ExecutionSequence);

    /// Claims a node for execution.
    async fn claim_node(&self, sequence_id: SequenceID, node_id: NodeID) -> Result<NodeClaimToken, ClaimError>;

    /// Submits the result of a node execution.
    async fn submit_node_result(&self, claim_token: NodeClaimToken, node_result: NodeResult) -> Result<(), SubmissionError>;

    /// Subscribes to execution sequences with a callback function.
    async fn subscribe_to_sequences<F>(&self, callback: F) -> Subscription
    where
        F: Fn(ExecutionSequenceMessage) -> impl Future<Output = ()> + Send + 'static;

    /// Monitors a sequence for execution status updates as a stream.
    async fn monitor_sequence(&self, sequence_id: SequenceID) -> impl Stream<Item = ExecutionStatus> + Send;
}

```

## Security Considerations

The register-based communication layer incorporates several security measures:

1. **Proof Verification**: All shared ZK proofs are verified before acceptance
2. **Content Addressing**: Proofs and states are referenced by content-hash for integrity
3. **DoS Protection**: Rate limiting and resource allocation for proof sharing
4. **Peer Authentication**: Authentication of peers for sensitive operations
5. **Work Validation**: Validation of execution results before acceptance
6. **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based protection against message replay
7. **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data transfer
