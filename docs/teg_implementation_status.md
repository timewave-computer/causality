# Temporal Effect Graph Implementation Status

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Temporal Effect Graph (TEG) intermediate representation as defined in the implementation plan (`work/014.md`).

## Completed Components

### Phase 1: Core TEG Structure

- ✅ `causality-ir` crate has been created
- ✅ Core data structures are implemented (`EffectNode`, `ResourceNode`, `TEGFragment`, etc.)
- ✅ Graph edge relationships are established
- ✅ Content addressing is implemented
- ✅ Serialization support is in place
- ✅ Builder API for graph construction

### Phase 2: TEL → TEG Translator (Functor F)

- ✅ `TEGFragment` struct with composition methods
- ✅ `ToTEGFragment` trait implementation (functor F)
- ✅ Translators for TEL combinators (I, K, S, B, C, Application, Literal, Reference)
- ✅ Translators for effect combinators (Effect, StateTransition, ContentAddressing)
- ✅ Translators for resource combinators (Resource, Query)
- ✅ Functorial properties implemented (identity preservation, composition preservation)
- ✅ Preservation of monoidal structure

### Phase 2: Integration with causality-tel

- ✅ Add dependency on `causality-ir` in causality-tel
- ✅ Implement `program_to_teg` function in compiler.rs
- ✅ Add `to_metadata` method to `EffectDef` for TEG metadata integration
- ✅ Implement `incorporate_fragment` and `add_effect_metadata` in TemporalEffectGraph

### Phase 3: Update Engine to Consume TEG

- ✅ Update `causality-engine` to depend on `causality-ir`
- ✅ Implement TEG executor in engine
- ✅ Create `TegExecutor` class with execution logic
- ❌ Update resource management for TEG
- ❌ Integrate with existing engine components
- ❌ Create comprehensive execution API

### Phase 6: TEG → TEL Translator (Functor G)

- ✅ `ToTELCombinator` trait
- ✅ Implementation for various node types (effect nodes, resource nodes)
- ✅ Full graph translation capability
- ✅ Functorial property verification

## Incomplete Components

### Phase 3: Remaining Engine Integration

- ❌ Adapt effect handling to work with TEG instead of directly executing combinators
- ❌ Update resource management for TEG
- ❌ Integrate with existing engine components
- ❌ Create comprehensive execution API

### Phase 4: Optimization Passes

- ✅ Basic optimization framework
- ✅ Some optimizations implemented (Dead effect elimination, Effect inlining, Constant folding)
- ❌ Resource-specific optimizations
- ❌ Cross-domain optimizations
- ✅ Validation passes

### Phase 5: Multi-target Code Generation

- ❌ Code generation framework
- ❌ Target implementations (Ethereum VM, CosmWasm, Native Rust)
- ❌ Testing framework for code generation

### Phase 7: TEG Graph API for External Consumption

- ❌ Comprehensive graph API
- ❌ Serialization formats for external systems
- ❌ Graph data structure for external consumption
- ❌ Graph query capabilities
- ❌ Programmatic graph manipulation

### Phase 8: Cleanup and Code Removal

- ❌ Remove deprecated TEL execution code
- ❌ Update executor API
- ❌ Clean up old tests
- ❌ Documentation updates

## Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan and current status, the following tasks should be prioritized:

1. **Complete Engine Integration**:
   - Complete effect handling integration with TEG
   - Update resource management to work with TEG resource nodes
   - Integrate with existing engine components

2. **Create End-to-End Tests**:
   - Create tests for the TEL → TEG → Execution pipeline
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Validate execution results

3. **Complete Optimization Passes**:
   - Implement resource-specific optimizations
   - Implement cross-domain optimizations

These tasks will enable the end-to-end use of TEG as the intermediate representation between TEL and the execution engine, realizing the category theoretic adjunction described in the architecture documents.
