# Causality Architecture

This section contains the architectural specifications and design decisions for the Causality system.

## Core Architecture

- [Resource System](resource-system.md): The resource system architecture
- [Effect System](effect-system.md): The effect system architecture
- [Three-Layer Effect Architecture](three-layer-effect-architecture.md): The three-layer approach to effect handling
- [Capability System](capability-system.md): The capability system architecture
- [Content Addressing](content-addressing.md): Content addressing architecture
- [Time System](time-system.md): The time system architecture
- [Agent-Based Resources](agent-based-resources.md): The agent-based resource system
- [Domain System](domain-system.md): Cross-domain operations and boundary crossing
- [TEL System](tel-system.md): Temporal Effect Language for cross-domain operations

## Domain Architecture

- [Domain Model](domain-model.md): The unified domain adapter pattern

## Integration and Reference

- [Unified System Components](unified-system-components.md): Integration of system components
- [Concept-to-Code Mapping](concept-to-code-mapping.md): Mapping between architectural concepts and code implementations

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

The canonical Architectural Decision Records are maintained in their original form in the [spec/](../../spec/) directory. These are historical documents that record the decisions made during the development of the system.

The [ADR Index](adr-index.md) provides a summary of all ADRs and shows relationships between them, indicating which ADRs have been superseded or extended by later decisions.

## System Specification

The comprehensive [System Specification](../../spec/spec.md) document provides the authoritative description of the Causality system architecture. The documentation in this directory is derived from this specification and organized by component for easier navigation.
