## Unified ResourceRegister Model

This document outlines the key architecture decisions made during the development of the unified ResourceRegister model, lifecycle management, and relationship tracking systems.

## Core Design Decisions

### 1. Separation of Lifecycle and Relationship Concerns

**Decision**: Split resource management into two primary components: a lifecycle manager and a relationship tracker.

**Rationale**:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
- Independent evolution: Components can evolve separately as requirements change
- Simpler testing: Lifecycle state transitions and relationship management can be tested in isolation
- Optional usage: Applications can use just the lifecycle manager or just the relationship tracker as needed

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires more coordination when both aspects need to change together
- Additional integration points to maintain

### 2. State-Based Lifecycle Model

**Decision**: Model resource lifecycle as explicit states rather than events or flags.

**Rationale**:
- Clarity: Explicit states make the current status of a resource immediately obvious
- Validation: State transitions can be validated based on current state
- History: Transition history provides an audit trail
- Predictability: State machine model ensures resources follow consistent patterns

**Trade-offs**:
- More rigid than a flag-based system
- New states require changes to transition logic

### 3. Typed Relationship Model

**Decision**: Use a typed relationship model rather than generic connections.

**Rationale**:
- Semantics: Relationships carry specific meaning in the domain model
- Querying: Easier to query for specific types of relationships
- Constraints: Different relationship types can have different constraints
- Documentation: Types help self-document the system structure

**Trade-offs**:
- Less flexibility than a generic graph model
- New relationship types require code changes

### 4. Mutability Control Through States

**Decision**: Control resource mutability through lifecycle states rather than permissions.

**Rationale**:
- Simplicity: State checks are simpler than permission checks
- Predictability: Mutation rules are consistent across the system
- Integration: Works well with blockchain models of state transitions
- Composability: States can be composed with capability-based permissions

**Trade-offs**:
- Less fine-grained control than a permission system
- Temptation to add too many states to handle special cases

### 5. Explicit Relationship Records

**Decision**: Maintain explicit relationship records rather than embedding references.

**Rationale**:
- Bidirectionality: Relationships can be traversed in either direction
- Metadata: Relationships can carry additional metadata
- History: Changes to relationships can be tracked
- Integrity: Easier to maintain referential integrity

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance: Requires additional lookups compared to direct references
- Storage: Requires more storage space
- Complexity: More complex than simple references

### 6. Strategy Pattern for Storage

**Decision**: Use the strategy pattern for resource storage methods.

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility: Different storage strategies for different use cases
- Privacy: Support for privacy-preserving storage models
- Adaptability: Can adapt to different blockchain environments
- Evolution: New storage strategies can be added without changing client code

**Trade-offs**:
- Complexity: More complex than a single storage model
- Testing: Each strategy needs separate testing
- Migration: Moving between strategies can be challenging

### 7. Template Approach for Common Operations

**Decision**: Provide templates for common resource operations rather than low-level APIs.

**Rationale**:
- Correctness: Templates ensure operations are performed correctly
- Consistency: Operations are performed the same way across the system
- Simplicity: Higher-level abstraction is easier to use
- Adaptability: Templates can be specialized for specific domains

**Trade-offs**:
- Reduced flexibility for specialized cases
- Learning curve for understanding the templates
- Additional layer of abstraction

### 8. Integration with Capability-Based Authorization

**Decision**: Integrate with capability-based authorization rather than role-based access control.

**Rationale**:
- Granularity: Capabilities provide fine-grained control
- Delegation: Capabilities can be delegated to other entities
- Composition: Capabilities can be composed for complex authorization rules
- Decentralization: Works well in decentralized environments

**Trade-offs**:
- Complexity: More complex than simple role-based systems
- Management: Capability management requires careful tracking
- Understanding: Steeper learning curve for developers

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Rust-Based Implementation

**Decision**: Implement the core model in Rust.

**Rationale**:
- Safety: Rust's ownership model prevents many common bugs
- Performance: Rust provides near-native performance
- Interoperability: Rust can be used across different platforms
- WebAssembly: Easy compilation to WebAssembly for browser use

**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve: Rust has a steeper learning curve than some languages
- Ecosystem: Some libraries may not be available in Rust
- Development speed: Sometimes slower development compared to dynamic languages

### 2. Hash-Based Identity

**Decision**: Use string-based identifiers for resources.

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility: Can accommodate different ID generation schemes
- Readability: String IDs are human-readable
- Interoperability: Strings work well across language boundaries
- Serialization: Easy to serialize and deserialize

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance: Hash lookups rather than direct indexing
- Size: Larger size compared to numeric IDs
- Validation: Requires validation of ID format

### 3. Immutable Records with Cloning

**Decision**: Use immutable records with cloning for state updates.

**Rationale**:
- Safety: Prevents partial updates and race conditions
- Clarity: Makes state changes explicit
- History: Facilitates tracking historical state
- Consistency: Ensures consistent views of state

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance: Cloning can be expensive for large structures
- Memory: Potentially higher memory usage
- Programming model: Requires careful handling of updates

### 4. Three-Layer Effect Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a three-layer architecture for effects.

**Rationale**:
- Abstraction: Foundation layer provides basic abstractions
- Specialization: Domain-specific layer adapts to specific chains
- Composition: Composite layer enables higher-level operations
- Reuse: Common patterns can be reused across layers

**Trade-offs**:
- Complexity: More complex than a flat architecture
- Indirection: May make debugging more difficult
- Learning curve: Developers need to understand the layers

## Future Directions

### 1. GraphQL Interface

**Decision**: Plan to provide a GraphQL interface for querying resource relationships.

**Rationale**:
- Query flexibility: GraphQL allows flexible queries over the resource graph
- Traversal: Natural fit for traversing relationships
- Client flexibility: Clients can request exactly what they need
- Documentation: Self-documenting API through the schema

### 2. Enhanced Relationship Semantics

**Decision**: Enhance relationship semantics with more specific types.

**Rationale**:
- Domain modeling: Better represents domain-specific relationships
- Constraints: Can enforce more specific constraints on relationships
- Queries: More precise queries based on relationship semantics
- Documentation: Richer semantic documentation of the system

### 3. Time-Based State Transitions

**Decision**: Support time-based state transitions in the future.

**Rationale**:
- Automation: States can change automatically based on time
- Scheduling: Operations can be scheduled for future execution
- Expiration: Resources can expire after a certain time
- Temporal logic: Better integration with temporal logic systems

### 4. Statistical Analysis of Resource Graphs

**Decision**: Plan for statistical analysis capabilities for resource graphs.

**Rationale**:
- Insights: Derive insights from resource relationship patterns
- Optimization: Identify optimization opportunities
- Anomaly detection: Detect unusual patterns that might indicate issues
- Prediction: Predict future system behavior based on current patterns
